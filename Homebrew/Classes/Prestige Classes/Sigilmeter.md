### Class Features

#### <u>Book of Sigilmetry</u>: 
Add all Truename Spells to the spell list of the spellcasting class which gave you access to this spell. If that spellcasting class uses a spellbook, you may convert and henceforth use a unique system for
recording the details of a spell that drastically reduces the expense of maintaining spellbooks. Every spell he learns from now on requires only a single page in his spellbook. It still takes 1 hour per spell level to scribe a spell into a spellbook and materials costing the same as for a normal spellbook.

A sigilmeter's spellbook is difficult for nonsigilmeters/nongeometers to
decipher and use. The Spellcraft DC to decipher or prepare
spells from a sigilmeter spellbook is increased by 5 for
nonsigilmeters/nongeometers. 

#### <u>Sigilmetry</u>; 
You may make Mysterycraft checks in place of Truespeak checks for the purposes of speaking Utterances, Recitation Feats, and Truename Spells. Gain a +2 Bonus on Mysterycraft checks for every level in this class.

Additionally, you may use Knowledge (Esoterica) in place of any knowledge check required for Truename Research. As though it were bardic knowledge, with a bonus on the research check equal to your class level.

#### <u>Expressions</u>:
You have learned how to inscribe Truenames as Glyphs in sacred geometric and mathematical form. 

You gain a number of Expressions each class level based on the following tables: 

<u>Expressions Known</u>
| Level | Lexicon of the Evolving Mind | Lexicon of the Crafted Tool | Lexicon of the Perfected Map |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
1st | 1 | -- | -- |
2nd | 2 | -- | -- |
3rd | 3 | 1 | -- |
4th | 4 | 2 | 1 |
5th | 5 | 3 | 2 |

<u>Maximum Expression Level Known</u>
| Level | Lexicon of the Evolving Mind | Lexicon of the Crafted Tool | Lexicon of the Perfected Map |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
1st | 1st | -- | -- |
2nd | 2nd | -- | -- |
3rd | 2nd | 1st | -- |
4th | 3rd | 1st | 1st |
5th | 3rd | 2nd | 1st |

These expressions are chosen from the Lexicons of Utterances (see Tome of Magic 3.5e). Just like Utterances these are cast as spell-like abilities; however, with the following differences: Expressons are silent and require no verbalizing. You must succeed on a Mystercraft check using the Sigilmetry class feature or a Truespeak check to cast an Expression. To cast an Expression requires a suitable writing implement, components and a firm surface to 'write' on. You inscribe the glyph as part of making the Mystercraft check. You must have at least 1 hand free and able to write with a suitable implement on some form of suitable media. DM's discretion as to what suitable means; but examples include (inkpen and parchment, wet blood on a finger inscribing on a cave floor). 

Treat Expressions exactly like Utterances for the purposes of interacting with other Feats and Class abilities, or meeting requirements. 

#### <u>Bonus Metamagic Feat</u>:
At 2nd level choose a metamagic feat that you did not choose when taking the Sacred Geometry Feat. You may now use this metamagic feat with Sacred Geometry as well. 

At 4th level choose another metamagic feat that you did not choose when taking the Sacred Geometry Feat. You may now use this metamagic feat with Sacred Geometry as well. 

#### <u>Express Recitation</u>: 
Starting at 3rd level you have learned how to use a Recitation feat as a permanent expression. Choose one recitation feat that you know (if you do not know any recitation feats, choose one that you meet the prerequisites for). The effect of that recitation is now permanent as long as you keep its inscribed expression in your possession.  

#### <u>Powerful Spell Sigils</u>:
At 5th level, you have learned how to combine other forms of spellcasting with Sigilmetry. If you succeed on a Mystercraft check while casting any spell you mystically trace out an expression of that creature's truename and weave it into the spell effect, increasing the DC of that spell by +2.
