## Class Features

### Gigantic Companion (Ex)
The size of a Beast Lord’s companion (see below) increases to Huge. The creature takes a -1 penalty on attack rolls and to AC, and a -2 penalty to Dexterity (to a minimum of 1); its base damage increases by one size category; and its reach increases to 10 feet. It also gains a +2 size bonus to its Strength and Constitution. At 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, the Strength bonus increases by an additional 2; the bonus to Constitution increases by an additional 2 at 5th and again at 9th level.

### Companion (Ex)
A Beast Lord can choose from among the following animal companions to serve as her loyal companion: amargasaurus, arsinoitherium, aurochs, baluchitherium, brontotherium, camel, cat (big), deinotherium, dire polar bear, elasmotherium, elk, horse, kentrosaurus, mastodon, megaloceros, moa, rhinoceros, styracosaurus, triceratops, uintatheriumB5, wolf, woolly mammoth (use the statistics for a mastodon), or woolly rhinoceros. A GM might expand this list to include other possible companions. This companion functions as a druid’s animal companion, replacing any animal companion or mount gained from another class.

The Beast Lord’s class levels stack with other classes that grant an animal companion to determine her effective druid level.

### Wild Coercion (Ex)
A Beast Lord gains the wild empathy ability; this functions exactly like the druid ability of the same name. For the purposes of this ability, her class level stacks with all other classes that have the wild empathy ability. In addition, a Beast Lord can use her wild empathy to demoralize an animal or magical beast, or force it to be friendly to her, as if using Intimidate rather than Diplomacy. She adds her Strength modifier to these checks in addition to her Charisma modifier.

### Bonus Feat
Pick a feat that relates to Animal Companions. You must still meet the prerequisites
### Rapid Straddle 
At 3rd level, a Beast Lord can attempt Ride checks to fast mount or fast dismount her companion even if it’s more than one size category larger than her, provided she still has a move action available that round.
### Rugged Companion
At 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, the natural armor bonus of a Beast Lord’s companion increases by 1.
### Daunting Companion
At 4th level, a Beast Lord adds her class level as a bonus to intimidate checks if her Gigantic Companion is present. 
### Valiant Devotion
At 5th level, a Beast Lord’s companion gains a +4 morale bonus against charm, compulsion, and fear effects.
### Dire Companion
Gigantic Companion gains the Dire Creature template; it's size cannot increase above Colossal
