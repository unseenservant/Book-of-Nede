### Class Features

#### <u>Book of Sigilmetry</u> (ex); 
Spells in Spellbooks only use single page no matter spelllevel. Harder for others to decode. 

#### <u>Sigils (Su)</u>; 
Pick 3 Utterances per Geometer Level, cannot pick an Utterance of a higher level than your Geometer Level. 

#### <u>SpellGlyph (Su)</u>:
Optionally, may choose to prepare spells as **Silenced** without using a higher level spell slot; no prepared spells require material components (other than focuses). Spells prepared in this way may not be **Stilled**

#### <u>SigilSight (Su)</u>:
Get automatic Perception check to notice traps based on sigils, symbols, glyphs etc if within 10ft. Get a bonus on Perception checks equal to class level to find sigils, symbols, glyphs etc. 

#### <u>Pass Symbol (Su)</u>: 
Make a caster level check, (DC 11+Caster Level) vs a sigils, symbols, glyphs, rune etc to temporarily disable it without triggering it. Can keep it disabled as long as you concentrate. Must be able to see the target to use this ability.   


#### <u>Powerful SpellGlyphs (Su)</u>:
Optionally, may choose to prepare spells as **Heightened** without using a higher level spell slot. Spells prepared in this way may not be **Stilled**






Sacred Geometry: As the feat

Sigilmetry: treat Spellcraft like Truename for the purposes of making Truename checks. Gain a +2 Bonus on Truename checks for every level in the Geometer PrC. 

Expressions: Can use Utterances from the Truenamer class 'silently' using Spellcraft skill. They are now called Expressions. Requires material components and a firm surface to 'write' on. Only utterances gained / learned / acquired from a level in this PrC can be used as Expressions -- utterances gained/learned/acquired from levels in a different class cannot be used as Expressions. 

Theurge with Truenamer for Utterances/Spells. 

++ all the same Glyph stuff the Geometer normally gets vanilla
