# Hexblade
Combining the dynamic powers of martial prowess and arcane might, the hexblade presents a deadly challenge to opponents unused to such a foe.

Hexblades adventure for personal gain, whether that gain is power, prestige, wealth, or all the above. Characteristics: The hexblade balances talents in combat and arcane spellcasting. At lower levels, the hexblade relies on melee ability augmented by his special power to curse his enemies. As he gains experience, he becomes capable of casting a limited number of spells while his curse ability becomes more potent and he gains the ability to warp the normal laws of probability. He can also draw upon the service of a familiar to further augment his abilities.

The style of the hexblade tends to be selfish, sometimes even cruel, though it is by no means limited to evil characters. Still, even the friendliest hexblade is at best neutral. Hexblades may be tyrannical or free-minded, disciplined or creative, and thus have no particular bent toward law or chaos.

Most hexblades aren't very pious, relying on their own talents rather than counting on a deity to protect them. Those who revere a deity often choose Wee Jas (deity of death and magic) or Boccob the Uncaring (deity of magic). Some particularly evil hexblades venerate Nerull (deity of death) or Vecna (deity of secrets).

Like that of the sorcerer, the power of the hexblade often displays itself at an early age, frequently in the form of unexplained accidents or other incidents of bad luck experienced by those around the budding hexblade. Though the hexblade is ultimately a self-taught character, many receive rudimentary training from another arcane spellcaster, such as an older hexblade, sorcerer, wizard, or bard, before setting off on their own.

Unlike sorcerers, hexblades share a unique bond. Though two hexblades who meet in a tavern or apothecary won't necessarily strike up a lasting friendship, it is rare for two hexblades to oppose one another unless great personal gain is on the line.

As with sorcerers, most hexblades are humans or half-elves. Those few gnomes who enjoy a cruel twist to their levity may take up the tradition. Elves wishing to mix magic and warfare more often become fighter/wizards. Dwarves and halflings rarely exhibit the self-centered behavior common among hexblades. Among the savage humanoids, hexblades may be found as leaders or advisors.

Hexblades tend to get along best with other classes whose members look out for themselves before others, including rogues, rangers, and barbarians. They avoid paladins and other characters dedicated to the service of good or other high-minded ideals. Hexblades sometimes feel jealous of the sorcerer's superior arcane talents, and they shun wizards as weak book-learners.

Though a capable melee combatant, the hexblade relies on opportunistic use of his spells and special abilities to augment this role in the group. A hexblade with the proper skill selection can make a fine leader for a group comfortable with his style.

## Class Features

### Witch's Familiar

At 1st level, a hexblade forms a close bond with a familiar, a creature that teaches her magic and helps to guide her along her path. Familiars also aid a hexblade by granting her skill bonuses, additional spells, and help with some types of magic. This functions like the wizard’s arcane bond class feature, except as noted in the hexblade’s Familiar section.

A hexblade must commune with her familiar each day to regain her spells. Familiars store all of the spells that a hexblade knows. A hexblade’s familiar begins play storing no spells. The hexblade also selects a number of additional 1st-level spells equal to her Intelligence modifier to store in her familiar. Beginning at 4th level and each each new hexblade level, her familiar learns spells according to the table "Hexblade Spells Known" (see below). A hexblade can also add additional spells to her familiar through a special ritual.

### Eldritch Resistance

At 2nd level, an hexblade gains a bonus equal to his Charisma bonus (if any) on all saving throws

### Eldritch Pool (Sp): 
An hexblade gains an eldritch pool of personal magical energy, equal to 1/2 his hexblade level (minimum 1) + his Charisma modifier. As a swift action, he can spend a point of eldritch energy to enter a state of mystical focus for 2 rounds. This allows him to use Elder Mystery class feature and perform an accursed strike (see below). At 4th level, an hexblade can also use his eldritch pool as an arcane pool, gaining all the benefits listed with the magus’s arcane pool class feature.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;accursed strike (su): A hexblade who can cast any spell with the curse descriptor (such as *bestow curse*) can deliver these spells using the using this ability, even if the spells are not touch attack spells. Additionally, instead of delivering a spell a hexblade may instead choose to deliver an Elder Mystery

A hexblade cannot use magus arcana.

Otherwise this ability functions like a magus's arcane pool.

### Misfortune-Hex

 The hexblade can cause a creature within 30 feet to suffer grave misfortune for 1 round. Anytime the creature makes an ability check, attack roll, saving throw, or skill check, it must roll twice and take the worse result. A Will save negates this hex. At 8th level and 16th level, the duration of this hex is extended by 1 round. This hex affects all rolls the target must make while it lasts. Whether or not the save is successful, a creature cannot be the target of this hex again for 1 day.

### Mettle
At 4th level and higher, a hexblade can resist magical and unusual attacks with great willpower or fortitude. If he makes a successful Will or Fortitude save against an attack that normally would have a lesser effect on a successful save (such as any spell with a saving throw entry of Will half or Fortitude partial), he instead completely negates the effect. An unconscious or sleeping hexblade does not gain the benefit of mettle

### Spells
A hexblade casts arcane spells drawn from the witch spell list. 

Like other spellcasters, a hexblade can cast only a certain number of spells of each level per day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table: hexblade. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Charisma score. The hexblade does not need to prepare these spells in advance; he can cast any spell he knows at any time, assuming he hasn’t yet used up his allotment of spells per day for the spell’s level.

The hexblade’s selection of spells is limited. At 4th level, a hexblade knows two 1st-level spells of his choice. A hexblade gains more spells as he increases in level, as indicated on Table: hexblade Spells Known. Unlike spells per day, the number of spells a hexblade knows is not affected by his Charisma score, but it is affected by any bonus spells he gains from his bloodline. At 8th level and every 3 levels thereafter, a hexblade can choose to learn a new spell in place of one he already knows. This swap follows all the same rules as for a sorcerer.

```

A hexblade can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Table: hexblade. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Charisma score (see Table: Ability Modifiers and Bonus Spells).

### Patron Spells
At 4th level, when a hexblade gains her familiar, she must also select a patron. This patron is a vague and mysterious force, granting the hexblade power for reasons that she might not entirely understand. While these forces need not be named, they typically hold influence over one of the following forces.

At 4th level, and every two levels thereafter, a hexblade’s patron adds new spells to a hexblade’s list of spells known. These spells are also automatically added to the list of spells stored by the familiar. The spells gained depend upon the patron chosen. Each patron is listed by its theme. Its actual name is up to the GM and the hexblade to decide.

### Elder Mystery

At 3rd level, and every three levels thereafter, an hexblade can select one Elder Mystery. Each Elder Mystery adds an effect to the hexblade’s touch of corruption ability. Whenever the hexblade uses touch of corruption to deal damage to one target, the target also receives the additional effect from one of the cruelties possessed by the hexblade. This choice is made when the touch is used. The target receives a Fortitude save to avoid this Elder Mystery. If the save is successful, the target takes the damage as normal, but not the effects of the Elder Mystery. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the hexblade’s level + the hexblade’s Charisma modifier.

At 3rd level, the antipaladin can select from the following initial cruelties.

> Fatigued: The target is fatigued.
> Shaken: The target is shaken for 1 round per level of the antipaladin.

At 6th level, an antipaladin adds the following cruelties to the list of those that can be selected.

> Dazed: The target is dazed for 1 round.
> Staggered: The target is staggered for 1 round per two levels of the antipaladin.

At 9th level, an antipaladin adds the following cruelties to the list of those that can be selected.

> Cursed: The target is cursed, as if the antipaladin had cast bestow curse, using his antipaladin level as his caster level. \
> Frightened: The target is frightened for 1 round per two levels of the antipaladin. The antipaladin must have the shaken Elder Mystery before selecting this Elder Mystery. \ 



At 12th level, an antipaladin adds the following cruelties to the list of those that can be selected.
> Blind/Deaf: The target is blinded or deafened for 1 round per level of the antipaladin. \
> Panic: The target is panicked for 1 round per level of the antipaladin. \
> Confused: The target is confused for 1 round. \
> Stunned: The target is stunned for 1 round per four levels of the antipaladin.

These abilities are not cumulative. For example, a 12th-level hexblade's Elder Mystery might cause the target to become fatigued, dazed, poisoned, or diseased. Once a Elder Mystery is chosen, it can’t be changed.

### Hex
Hexblades learn a number of magic tricks, called hexes, that grant them powers or weaken foes. At 1st level, a hexblade gains one hex of her choice. She gains an additional hex at 2nd level and for every 2 levels attained after 2nd level, as noted on Table: hexblade. A hexblade cannot select an individual hex more than once.

Unless otherwise noted, using a hex is a standard action that does not provoke an attack of opportunity. The save to resist a hex is equal to 10 + 1/2 the hexblade’s level + the hexblade’s Charisma modifier.

### Greater Misfortune Hex

 The hexblade can repeatedly afflict a creature with her misfortune-hex ability any number of times per day, regardless of whether the creature has already made a saving throw against the misfortune-hex within the last 24hrs. 

### Baleful Aura

At 10th level, enemies within 10 feet of an hexlblade take a –2 penalty on all saving throws.

This ability functions only while the hexblade is conscious, not if he is unconscious or dead.

### Major Hex
Starting at 12th level, and every two levels thereafter, a hexblade can choose one of the following major hexes whenever she could select a new hex.

### Greater Baleful Aura

The penalty from the hexblade's Baleful Aura ability increases to -4

### Grand Hex
Starting at 18th level, and every two levels thereafter, a hexblade can choose one of the following grand hexes whenever she could select a new hex.

### Dire Misfortune Hex

A creature afflicted by a hexblade's misfortune-hex ability must roll thrice and take the worse result 

### Baleful Lord

Ability checks, attack rolls, saving throws, skill checks, or caster level checks, enemies make within 30ft of the hexlbade suffer a -6 penalty (this does not stack with Greater Baleful Aura). Additionally, any effect originating from an enemy that targets the hexblade or her allies suffers 20% miss chance. Once per day as an immediate action, the Hexblade can select a target within her Baleful Aura and declare that the next spell the target casts is affected as if by *spell turning*.
