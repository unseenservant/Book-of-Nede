## Promises, Progress, Payoff 

Inspiration: 

The inspiration for the plot structure is The Matrix. 

Ivan == Neo, 
Material Reality == the Matrix, 
Agents == "Traditional Heroes" (Knights of Aidel?)


### Promises
- ~~The Dream Controls you~~ -> You're Inescapably Enslaved 
- Ivan's Enslaved

### Progress
Note(slavery): destroying the system is **not** better
Note(Ivan): every 'progress' comes at a cost to his loved ones

- Choice to accept call to action (white rabbit)
- Choice to unlock hidden powers (red pill)
- Choice to do something extraordinary(free morpheus)
- Choice to be reborn (become the one)


### Payoffs 
- Ivan gains the power to free himself
- Freedom is yours (twist) it isn't "slavery" better! 


## Outline

Set 15ish years in the future 

$Kights of Aidel have bound Mapleyne and forced her to reveal where Ivan is being raised peacefully; as they are looking to permanently imprison his soul.

 Valka/Sif is watching over Athena & Ivan while they live peacefully, from afar (like Obi-wan.) 

When Aidel forces attack their home, Athena tries to fight them off - telling Ivan to flee and find the Cairndal elves. 

Valka helps Ivan to flee the valley, knowing/seeing that the Aidel are too strong & that staying would only endanger her elf-family. 

Picking up Enwenen (for elf reasons) Valka believes the only way to really stand a chance is to train/awaken Ivan to his Elder powers. 

While Valka's idea is to find Frank in Fjenst in the still mostly zombified Northwest; they find Frank being captured by the Aidel as well. 

Learning a little from their brief interaction with Frank as he is being captured - Valka "holds them off" , instructing Ivan to flee and get as far away from the Aidel as he can. 

Ivan (and any additional NPCs they may have picked up this far) decide that the best thing to do is say "fuck it we ball" and track the Aidel back to their HQ. 

Ivan and cohorts then confront the Aidel and their leader ; who reminds Ivan that if he doesn't surrender himself eventually he will die of natural causes & Zh'Ash will destroy everything & everyone. Ivan chooses to embrace his nature as Zh'Ash and wipes the floor with the Aidel and freeing Frank+Athena. 

### Setting up Book 2

Ivan wants to "fix the afterlife", Luxi & the Gods are alerted to Ivan's power by the combat with the Aidel, and Ivan will need to find Thyra to continue his training in the Occult by a trusted mentor.1
