## Promises, Progress, Payoff 

Inspiration: 

The inspiration for the plot structure is The Matrix. 

Ivan == Neo, 
Material Reality == the Matrix, 
Agents == "Traditional Heroes" (Knights of Aidel?)


### Promises
- ~~The Dream Controls you~~ -> You're Inescapably Enslaved 
- Ivan's Enslaved

### Progress
Note(slavery): destroying the system is **not** better
Note(Ivan): every 'progress' comes at a cost to his loved ones

- Choice to accept call to action (white rabbit)
- Choice to unlock hidden powers (red pill)
- Choice to do something extraordinary(free morpheus)
- Choice to be reborn (become the one)


### Payoffs 
- Ivan gains the power to free himself
- Freedom is yours (twist) it isn't "slavery" better!
