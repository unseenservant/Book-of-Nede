# The Magic of Nede


## The Planes and their importance

Magic in this setting has a lot to do with where the source of power comes from. Very often, for most kinds of spells or magical effects, the fuel for magic will be drawn from a Plane of that element/power. 

It is also important to understand that all of "the setting", is contained within a 'boundary', and that outside that boundary more exists -- but not of this universe. Like the void in Lord of the Rings, or the space between dimensions in Marvel Comics.  

## Inner Magic & Outer Magic

[InnerMagic] refers to magic where it's ultimate source are the Tablets of Fate in the universe. [OuterMagic] refers to forms of power (that are basically magic, but magic of a different kind) whose ultimate source are beyond, or outside the scope of, the tablets of fate in the universe. 

## Inner Magic

### Truespeech & The Tablets of Fate

All that is in all realities within the Setting, are governed by The Tablets of Fate. They are a record of all things, all particles, all thoughts, all emotions, all physical laws, everything. They are not those things themselves, and those things can exist independent from the Tablets, but without the Tablets nothing can 'change states'. Applied forces would not cause effects, energy cannot be transfered, and all physics would break apart as states are unable to resolve. 

In that way, the Tablets act as a processor for every interaction between everything. The power that enables the Tablets is the highest form of 'magic' within the universe - this is referred to as the Power of Names, Words of Creation, or Truespeech. It was set in place by the Creator *after* the work of creation was complete. 

Truespeech, refers to the Power of Names, and being able to pronounce the name of a thing, in the way that the Tablets of Fate recognize the object or concept, can affect that thing. This is like in software developement, when you 'call' and object or function. So too can practitioners of Truespeech invoke 'functions' or call objects from the Tablets. This is also very similar to magic in other fantasy settings, like Eragon. The difference here is that Truespeech is not about the *word* itself being uttered, but about the pronunciation. Sound (that is energy waves through a media) produce arrangements or patterns in that media as they are transmitted. So too is the verbal uttering of Truespeech words, about creating the correct 'pattern' or arrangement in matter to represent what is written on the Tablets. 

This is extraordinarily difficult as even if one knew a word in Truespeech, one may not be able to pronounce it, or pronounce it correctly. Inviting botched and dangerous exercises of magic (like broken computer code) or more likely -- no effect at all. 

Which brings us too. ...

### Derived Magic

There are many kinds of Derived Magic, some more powerful than others. Some rarer than others. Each is a full discipline unto itself and each can theoretically perform 'anything' the practitioner could dream of with enough of the following ingredients: 

- Understanding/Knowledge
- Information
- Invention/Inspiration
- Skill/Practice

#### The Arcane | (Spellcraft) Magic assembled
Spells are all about the concepts of the **<u>Abjuration</u>** and **<u>Conjuration</u>** of planar power. A Spellconsists of: 
- Words of Creation
- Reagents or Foci
- Prepared representations of metaphysical reactions/implications. 

A spell is a singular construction of a combination of the above things. For example, a to create a *Fireball* might consist of a syllable of the [Truespeech] for **Fire** to <u>conjure</u> some plane of fire energy to react with the methane and phosphorous in some bat guano in a moderately complex hand gesture to represent the [Sigilmetry] of the interaction (effect). This specific combination or recipe is the spell and can be taught to anyone, for them to learn or cast the spell. 

Because of the planes used to provide power to the spells are different, Spellcraft is divided into different Arcane Schools: 
      - Zonomancy(Necromancy)
      - Elemancy(Evocation)
      -	Morphomancy(Transmutation)
      - Profimancy(Divination)
      - Noumancy(Illusion+Enchantment)
#### Elder Knowledge | The Occult, Magic invoked by 'alternative' means. 
Witchcraft 
- draws power from spirits, 
- invokes effects from [Ritual]
- taught by Patrons

Alchemy 
- draws power from physicality 
- invokes effects from [Ritual]
- discovered by Science

Occultism / Psychic Magic
- draws power from *others* minds/belief via the Astral Plane
- invokes effects by spell assembly
- discovered via hallucinogens & lucid dreaming 

#### Imbued | Magic on Loan
    Divine
    Nature
#### Esoterica | 
Ki 
- draws power from physicality (of one's body)
- invokes effects from state of mind & martial forms
- discovered by Monks 

Chakra
- draws power from spirit (one's own)
- invokes effects from health of spirit & body
- discovered by monks / gurus 

Blood
- draws power from one's own lifeforce or anothers 
- canonically very powerful and evil; invoked by a [Ritual] created bloodletter
- Taught to Witches, has splintered off since then. 

Sigilmetry
- draws power directly from the [TabletsofFate]
- invoked by geometric diagram representing complete [Truespeech]
- recorded by ancient Powers

Ritual
- draws power directly from the [TabletsofFate]
- invoked by specific actions, symbols, that represent the transformation from current metaphysical states to desired ones. Lengthy, time sensitive, and complex
- discovered/recorded by ancient Powers

#### Psionics
True psionic might is exceedingly rare, and rarer still is a psion with latent power developing it to a level they can control without killing themselves. 

- draws power directly from the user's own mind
- invoked by thought, directed by will 
- naturally occuring phenomena, likely the result of genetic or magical shenanigans in the psion's lineage. 


#### Pact
Pact magic is often used to empower binding agreements. However, its power runs much deeper than its already deeply realized use cases. Pact magic is responsible for empowering [Ritual] based magics, and is an emanated energy directly from the [TabletsOfFate]. 

- draws power directly from the [TabletsOfFate]
- cannot be invoked, except by [Ritually] created bargains, deals and covenants willingly agreed to 
- underpins the functioning of many features the [TabletsOfFate] provide.

## The Building Blocks 

### Sources
All inner magic is fueled by a source. That could be potential energy transformed into kinetic energy by winching a weight high up off the ground, or tapping into the plane of fire to fuel a spell of flames. 

The methods of moving potential energy around, or drawing, are to be represented as *if they were scientifically* done. Always adhering to the notion that a step-by-step process can be followed to move/transform energy from one place/form to another. 

### Casting
Building the mechanism that conducts the steps to produce an effect should always respect the source, and the type of magic. 

Esoterica magic always involves hidden or mysterious knowledge, philosophical realizations, wisdom
