  Description: | 
    Cairndal is located about 2 days north along the Dale Road from Frederiksborg Castle. 
    It is off the main trail by about a futher half-day. Making it an out of the way and quiet village 
    in the many Fjords and Valleys of Omerad. The village's close knit and troublefree population is 
    primarily human, with a few half-elves and many dwarves taking mercantile roles. 
    The city is not without renown in the region, as being the primary rest stop on the road
    to the Dwarven city of Silverroot - a trail rarely ventured upon by menfolk, but more so
    dwarven caravans making their way to market in wider human lands in between winters.

- Name: Cairn Pool 
  Description: |
    A clear blue lake that has formed from rain runoff at the bast of the 
    lone mountain in the middle of the Cairndal Valley. It's popular as a fishing stop
    for the locals and travelers alike. Water channels have been carved out from the lake
    running into the Cairndal Farms to the south - giving them a fresh water supply even in 
    dry months. 

- Name: Old Lookout
  Description: |
    A stone lookout tower built for one of the many previous wars the Kingdom 
    of Omerad has battled in throughout it's history. The now mostly decrepted tower
    is still barely standing watch at the top of a hill overlooking the crossroad between 
    the main thorough fair toward the capital Emhrais & the dale to the west. 

- Name: Skelgrav
  Description: |
    An old stone ruin of an ancient temple or fortress belonging to some forgotten
    civilization. The ruins locals call "Skelgrav" is a taboo for the people of the valley below.
    However, foolish children still make dares to go up and touch one of the pillars 
    - which still bares the weight of the mighty structure overshadowing the village below. 
    Thoughout its recorded history, the upper levels of the ruin have been home some visiting monsters;
    ranging from goblin tribes to deadlier things. Though the ruins lower levels have never 
    been explored to anyone's knowledge. The upper pillars and walls are reported to have eerie symbols 
    and strange busts visibly etched deep into the granite that forms the walls and structure. 

- Name: Cairndal Farms
  Description: |
    The farmland is irrigated by channels dug from the nearly Cairndal Pool.
    The soft fields of tundra wheat, livestock, barley and potatoes run 
    the breadth of the main road to the capital Emhrais from the Cairndal pool to the Elfwater. 
    The farmers live in the nearby village and venture out to their alloted plots each 
    day to perform their work as is traidition in Omerad culture; rather than making 
    homesteads out on their plots.

- Name: Elfwater
  Description: |
    So named for a family of Elves that is known to inhabit the area, 
    one that can be frequently spotted visiting this pond in particular. 
    The elven family is not known to be unfriendly to the Valleyfolk, 
    but it is custom to keep each race to themselves as much as possible. 
    Stories from a few generations ago tell of a young burgomeister who
    thought it a good idea to try and collect taxes from the Elves by 
    setting guards around the Elfwater - this was met with quite a few arrows. 
    Since then relations have been tense, at least on the valleyfolk side of things.
    Never sure if their next encounter with an Elf at the water will be amicable, 
    or an opportunity for the Elves to take some kind of vengeance for sins 
    no longer within human memory. 

- Name: Oldstones
  Description: |
    Nestled deep in the woods on the western edge in the old forest; just off the trail to Silverroot 
    lies the Oldstones. These ancient monuments seem reminiscent of gravestones like in the far south.
    Perhaps they are an old Druid circle, or Entmoot. The Valleyfolk do not know ; but the air 
    is pleasant near the stones, and the wind always gentle. The older children love to play games 
    in the shaded boughs of the trees near the stones and make little children of their own in private 
    weddings away from disapproving parental eyes. 

- Name: Five Pools
  Description: |
    Five pools of crystal clear mountain water sit in this forest glen. 
    Known to be a meeting place for the local Druid circle, these pools hold
    a sacred space in the hearts of the Valley folk. While it is rare enough to find
    a Druid meeting taking place - as they keep their schedule secret from common folk.
    It is often a good place to go and seek guidance from the Druids by leaving litte notes 
    for the woodkeepers to find. 

- Name: Quiet Place
  Description: |
    An old temple to an unknown god, this eerie edifice stands untouched by time
    save for the creepers that ensnare it now. The air is deathly still & the wind does not blow
    in the presence of this odd building. The valley folk keep away from this place, fearing a
    curse of silence be put upon themselves for trespassing. 

    Once, within living memory, a priest of Luxi goddess of light was travelling the Dale road 
    and heard tell of this Quiet Place. Believing it to be cursed she attempted to undo
    whatever magic held its snare - and was never *heard* from again. 

- Name: Blackhold 
  Description: |
    A tower built of strange polished black stones without markings or even seams between the bricks. 
    A few brave (or stupid) children have managed to get inside through the high windows that sit in
    the flat walls of the strucutre; and claim to have found odd relics of antiquity. 

    It was for a time in the Valley's history a sort of rite of passage for a boy when he comes of age
    to retrieve a relic from the Tower for his father. However that rite was ended when 43 years ago little 
    Jan Relksen climbed through the high window and was disappeared in a flash of white flames.  

- Name: Afsdal Farms

- Name: Bitter Pond
  Description: | 
    Long before human memory records, this was a beautiful pool like the others
    in the valley. However, when the Dwarves setup their mine in Silverroot - the runoff
    from their smithies poisoned the water and the farmland around it. 

    Fish no longer swim in these waters, and while local Apothecaries say the water 
    is good for healing salves - the many farmers of Alfsdal who've seen their farmland
    shrink because of the Dwarven carelessness. The Dwarven King of Silverroot has been 
    entreated several times, even by an emissary from Emhrais to take measures to restore the water
    but the Dwarves are nothing if not obstinate, and wealthy. So it is that the menfolk of Alfsdal 
    receive fine dwarven forged steel farm equipment just for the asking - in recompense.
