# Arch Fey 

## The First World

**Az'Arot, The Great Dreamer** Found Naede, an island of its own existence. Eventually, **He** would reach down and touch Naede, trying to enter it. 

The time before he touched Naede, this period is remembered by some - specifically herein - the **Fey**, as **The First World**. 

**The First World** was very different from Naede as it would later become after **the touch of the Dreamer**. The world was ordered, beautiful, raw, elemental, purposeful and formed. 

It was ruled by the **True Deities** in the absence of the Overgod, and **the great powers** served the gods. 

Some of these were Gods of the natural world, of elements and shapers of creation. These had created heirs - who were counted among **the great powers** and the chiefest of these were the **Archfey**. 

They were capricious, wild, the personifications of the beauty, savagery, viciousness and tranquility of the natural world. 

**The Fey** themselves are nature spirits, like **all the powers** and are formless unless they otherwise choose to be (or are forced to be). 

In **The First World**, there were few mortal forms of life; and the Fey were the most numerous of all living kinds. 

When **The Great Dreamer** touched Naede, it caused unfathomable devastation - not only to the world, but to the fabric of the planar structure the **True Deities** had established. 

This eventually lead to the **True Deities** creating more mortal life, the segregation of the planes, and the utter collapse of **the First World**. 

For untold eons since **The Beginning**, the **First World** has been a remnant of its past splendor. Existing as an eternally collapsing plane *beneath* the **Prime Material Plane**. 

Like a house that has not received any upkeep, it is a wornout and tired realm - bereft of inhabitants save the most determined Fey and other first life forms. 

In the earliest part of it's Twilight - the Archfey decreed an exodus for the fey from the first world - a casting out - to live on the Prime Material Plane as exiles. For their own safety. 

For the First World, in all it's elemental wild glory, was unmaintable without the **True Deities**.
