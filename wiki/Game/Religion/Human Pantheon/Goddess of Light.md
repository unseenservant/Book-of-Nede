Description: 

A beautiful young human woman with blonde hair that shines with many colors, and ethereal blue eyes that sparkle with motes inner light. She is lithe, almost elflike in the fairness of her complexion and has a soft voice like a gentle breeze. She is passionate and very petite standing shorter than most human women. Her gentle stature belies the might of her conviction and the blazing might of her power. 

History/Relationships:

Daughter of Sola and Noxa, Luxi is an ardent defender of the innocent and protector of life. She was the first to oppose Venecus's pursuit of mastery over Death. She is good friends with her uncle Rabelus and together they prosecuted a great crusade along the continent of Tier purging all evil doers and making the lands safe for goodly folk. 
She is the friendliest with the Elven Pantheon of all human gods, and closest with Corelleon Sunblade, Sehahnine and Labelas. 
She is known to be on rough terms with her parents, and has a "bad reputation" among Dwarves and Gnomes who find her apt to play tricks on them. 
She has many children who have formed the 'Order of Light' and serve their mother by rooting out evil and casting back shadows that endanger innocent life. 
    
Dogma: 

Purge evil wherever it is found, do not let it fester or hide. \
Do not suffer the witch to live, or the dead to walk. \
Death and darkness are the greatest enemies to life and safety. \
Blessed are they who do not speak in the shadows or conspire in the night.
