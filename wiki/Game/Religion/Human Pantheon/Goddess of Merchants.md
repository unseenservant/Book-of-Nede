Description: 
    Pecunia is a weathered but fair maid of middling years, whose appearance is like one who has known only the hard road and never home. Her hair is a common brown, and her bear colored eyes would be unremarkable if not for her penetratingly keen gaze. Her hands show no sign of hard labor, but her fingers are nimble and preternaturally lithe from the counting of coins or the constant signing of contracts. Her usual garb is that of a noblewoman, resplendant yet simple without gaudy displays of wealth; her attire commands attention by its professionalism. 

History/Relationships:
    Pecunia, one of the half-elven twins by Sylvanus & Sahaelis, definitely takes after her mother. A woman whose mind is ever shifting and who's goals are as diverse and long-planned as a master con-artist. 

    Her twin is Russo, the farmer, and they are of The House of the World. 

    In her beginnings, before she established a realm of her own - she studied long under Arakis, learning from him the value of gold, and the beauty of trade (though those were not the lessons he would've had her learn). 

    She is the oft lover of Rabelus, through whom she can exploit for greater profits and is a foe of Ientus whose gifts are free. 
    
Dogma: 
    Profits and a good deal are what matters. Money can buy happiness, money can buy anything. In life all you can have, is that which has value and there is nothing that cannot have a price. Be wise and shrewd, your weapons are words and your whetstone a keen mind. Keep those sharp and no one can defeat you, in any arena of life.
