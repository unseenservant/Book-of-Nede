# Arch Fey 

## The First World

**Az'Arot, The Great Dreamer** Found Naede, an island of its own existence. Eventually, **He** would reach down and touch Naede, trying to enter it. 

The time before he touched Naede, this period is remembered by some - specifically herein - the **Fey**, as **The First World**. 

**The First World** was very different from Naede as it would later become after **the touch of the Dreamer**. The world was ordered, beautiful, raw, elemental, purposeful and formed. 

It was ruled by the **True Deities** in the absence of the Overgod, and **the great powers** served the gods. 

Some of these were Gods of the natural world, of elements and shapers of creation. These had created heirs - who were counted among **the great powers** and the chiefest of these were the **Archfey**. 

They were capricious, wild, the personifications of the beauty, savagery, viciousness and tranquility of the natural world. 

**The Fey** themselves are nature spirits, like **all the powers** and are formless unless they otherwise choose to be (or are forced to be). 

In **The First World**, there were few mortal forms of life; and the Fey were the most numerous of all living kinds. 

When **The Great Dreamer** touched Naede, it caused unfathomable devastation - not only to the world, but to the fabric of the planar structure the **True Deities** had established. 

This eventually lead to the **True Deities** creating more mortal life, the segregation of the planes, and the utter collapse of **the First World**. 

For untold eons since **The Beginning**, the **First World** has been a remnant of its past splendor. Existing as an eternally collapsing plane *beneath* the **Prime Material Plane**. 

Like a house that has not received any upkeep, it is a wornout and tired realm - bereft of inhabitants save the most determined Fey and other first life forms. 

In the earliest part of it's Twilight - the Archfey decreed an exodus for the fey from the first world - a casting out - to live on the Prime Material Plane as exiles. For their own safety. 

For the First World, in all it's elemental wild glory, was unmaintable without the **True Deities**.

### The First

#### <u>Oberon</u>
Eldest and primarch of all Nature created by the absentee Overgod, the undisputed **Emperor of all the Fey**, and First among the First. Appearing like a elf with skin like fine pale stone and white hair like sunlight. This magestic Lord rules the House of the Tarot alongside his wife and eternal lover, **Morgana**. He is often clothed in a simple yet elegant tunic and wears a Crown of first starlight to have touched the First World. His glittering sword of judgement *Ringil* always rests at his hip.  

In his earliest days, when he beheld his sister Morgana he chased her throughout the First World like a panther stalks it's prey. After finally catching her, and forcing himself upon her, he restrained her for an eon or more. When she could resist his charms no longer, he freed her and married her in the first wedding ceremony. Where she tore out his right eye and cast it into the eternal seas of their world. He said to all his guests that it was worth all the pain to have her and he vowed never to seek out his eye as long as she remains with him. 

Like all Archfey - Oberon cares nearly nothing for the plights of Mortals who are so fortunate to have world of their own. When the First World began its collapse, Oberon felt *abandoned* by his Deity creators. He rallied many of his kin to use their power to try and hold their world together - with some success - but it was not assured; and has slowly crumbled ever since. When it became apparent that the Archfey were on their own, and their power would be insufficient, Oberon supported the censure of the Fey and their expulsion to the Material World. 

#### <u>Morgana</u>
The Empress of all Fey, is the embodiment of capricious fury in all nature's beauty and *sister* of Oberon and second born of all creation. The at-first-reluctant wife of Oberon, has endless raven-black locks of ever flowing hair on flawless pale stone skin, as if the finest porcelain. Her eyes however, are bottomless wells of hatred, fury, and mourning. For in the abusive captivity of Oberon she has lost the very thing that means most to a wild Fey - freedom. Though she eventually came to "love" her captor and through him rise to a height of power hitherto unknown except by perhaps the Overgod itself; she bides it all with an unspeakable sorrow. She carries the dagger she used to pry her husband's right-eye from it's socket on their wedding, *talesin*, which is black as night traced with fractures of white arcing power. 

Morgana awoke into a world unformed, dancing and frolicking in the wildlight. Until Oberon found her and became enthralled by her beauty - where he chased her throughout their earliest world. When he caught her, took her, imprisoned her, it was as though she had died each day of her captivity for eons. For she was the first of all things to be caged; to be without freedom. Each day Oberon tortured her with his *love* and each day she resisted his advances only to suffer at his hands. When eventually, her hatred consumed her - she came to love him back. Of her own volition she agreed to marry him and be eternally his - to be close enough to him ***to bring ruin*** upon all others things he held dear. 

They were married in the first wedding, in the sight of their many children & the gods. Together they've had countless children, but the most important of which are **Ternlan** & **Adana**, who went on to found the Seelie & Unseelie courts. In front of them all, she tore out her groom's right-eye; and vowed that for her love, one day she would destroy all Oberon had ever witnessed and then claim his second eye before the end of all things. 

From her husband's side, she has presided over the death of trillions, bringing unhinged ruin upon countless more. Morgana cares nearly nothing for the plights of Mortals who are so fortunate to have freedom of their own. Often she greatly empowers her servants only to withdraw her gifts at a time that will cause as much suffering as possible. Many still take her as their patron; willing to sacrifice many in their thirst for vengeance.

When **Az'Arot, The Great Dreamer** touched Naede and the great crumbling began - Morgana alone celebrated for the end of all things she had yearned for was begun. 

#### <u>Ephonee</u>

The Mother of Oni, the Queen of Shinigami, first Fey of Death; sister to Oberon, Morgana and Gaiel. Ephonee was born out of the dark deities' designs for impermanence and was created to be the high priestess of *the end of life*. She is the heirophant of the dead, servant of the Grim Reaper himself and protege of the Lords of Death. She remains the chieftess of the Shinigami, though the other Oni clans (including the Shinigami) have distanced themselves greatly from her since her Marriage. 

Near the beginning, she married Ternlan - son of Oberon and Morgana - who conquered her. Together they founded the Unseelie Court upon their *vow of woe*, a promise to see death flourish throughout all living things. 

It was Ephonee who taught Morgana of the end-of-life, and instructed her on the ways of ruin. 

Oni Daimyo and High Shinigami largely consider Ephonee to be a renegade from their strictures now - though many still venerate her and follow her ways. 

#### <u>Gaiel</u>

Father of Kami, King of the Living, First Fey of Life. Gaiel was born out of the dream of deities for creatures to live independently of the gods direct power. Brother to Oberon, Morgana and Ephonee - he was blessed by the *Living Lords* with undying life. He serves the *great fount* as its herald and apostle; fostering growth and the overspreading of life abundant wherever he goes. 

Near the beginning, he fell in love with Adana, daughter of Oberon and Morgana - who valued the purity of essence Gaiel carried and she esteemed his obedience to the Lords of Life. She helped him to create the Kami - independently of all the other Fey, to be guardians of their creations. It was this act that inspiried envy in Ephonee & Ternlan; who committed to the creation of the Oni(Yai) independently of the Fey as well. 

These fundamentally opposed lineages sparked the **Ageless War** and lead to the founding of the Seelie and Unseelie Courts.

## The House of the Tarot

While many Fey have a parentage that originates with one of the Archfey. The Archfey themselves do not always have a direct lineage. The First were created by the Gods who formed the cosmos. The members of the **House of the Tarot** are unique in that they are each direct creations by one or more Deities during the great beginnings of the First World. Oberon, Morgana, Ephonee & Gaiel were the First among Firsts; but the Begotten and Sired among the Tarot are also each without direct parentage. 

This makes understanding their power and **Spheres** difficult as each is more of a sibling, by mortal reckoning, to each other than parents or children. However, the whole House of the Tarot and all their descendants pay homage to Oberon and Morgana, who truly are the eminate rulers of all Fey. 

This House is concerned with the arrangement of Fate, or the *Telos* - in Sylvan *Taros* - of all things. They are the ordered chaos of the cosmos personified; the enslaved masters to the melody of the Gods' great orchestra. 

The House of the Tarot has no single abode or meeting place - but each member is of great enough power and will to have preserved their own Realms in the dying First World.
