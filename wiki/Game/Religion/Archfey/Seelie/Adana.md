Description: 
    Of raven hair like her mother **Morgana**, Adana is everything her mother is not and perhaps could've been. A beauty unstressed by time, eyes that sparkle with radiant hope and the flawless skin of her people. She dresses in a flowing gown of light woven from the last strands of first *wildlight* into a habit of long dead Gods of purity and perseverance. 

History/Relationships:
    The direct daughter of Morgana and Oberon, she is one of the few in the House of the Tarot to have true parentage. Though her story is not without oddity; as the stuff of her body was formed by Oberon inside Morgana's womb from *pure faith* given to him by a true goddess. 
    Adana is a believer in the perseverance of life, and of unceasing faith in its eventual triumph against *the end of life*. 
    She is the brother of **Ternlan**, and wife to **Gaiel** whose hope she fell so in love with that she forsook her station in the *Taros* to abide with Life in the Seelie Court. 
    
Dogma: 
    Like all Archfey she cares little for the affairs of mortals. However, she is very concerned with the fastness of faith and the persevering through hopelessness. Those who serve her find inner strength aplenty and a reserve of faith to draw upon in hard times not their own.
