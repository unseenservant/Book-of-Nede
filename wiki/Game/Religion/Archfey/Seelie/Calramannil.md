Description: 
The first of the Alfar, Calramannil is a tall regal figure of strong build and noble features. With the bearing of Oberon, Calramannil is often clad in strong silvery armor hewn from *timelessness* and his full-helm bears a visage like an Elf with many eyes. 

History/Relationships:
Calramannil is the progenitor of the Alfar race; a species of Fey devoted to the cause of life and the militant guardians against *the end of life*. An ally to other Powers for Good, he rules the Alfar from their great forest city of Miefl. His wife is an **Empyreal Lady Fioaa**, and though she is not the mother of Alfar, she has become their lady patron in battle. 

Calramannil opposes fiercly his 'brother' **Rirrannon** who is the progentior of the Svartalfar. A race Calramannil views as a mockery of his own kin and purpose. 

Long ago, an **unknown agent** caused a sect of Alfar to sin, and before the breaking of the First World - they were cast out by **Nonnicin** to what is now the Material Plane; where they became Elves. Calramannil still cares for his now mortal people, and opposes malevolent spirits and forces who would do his people harm. 

Dogma: 
Like all Archfey, Calramannil is not concerned with the plight of mortals, save the Elves. Those who serve him stand in opposition to darkness and the love of death. Defying corruption wherever it is found, they pursue abberations and dark Powers relentlessly.
