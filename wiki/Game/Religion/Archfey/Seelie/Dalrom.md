Description: 
    An endless shapeless swarm that somehow holds a vaguely humanoid appearance, only two piercing red lights can be seen from within the mass. It wraps itself in rough cloth spun from *Bebilith* silk, a shroud to hide its own hunger. 

History/Relationships:
    The offspring of **Hefem** Archfey of animate life, and **Thilro** Archfey of disease and virulence; Dalrom is odd among Unseelie. Namely, that as he sought ways to further Thilro's cause, he transformed himself by dark rite into a Swarm-that-Walks. Inventing a whole new form of life to contain his essence - that of insects - he discovered a twisted love for life. The making and changing of it. 

    For out of what was dead, he had succeeded in bringing himself forth and endless hordes of new species. While each individual life was nothing, together as a swarm they were a teeming endless roil of feasting death. One that he could make ever better. 

    So with his new found love, he pursued entry to the Seelie Court - so long as they permitted him to pursue the betterment of insectoid perfection; he would aid them in ensuring that life was not snuffed out. 
    
Dogma: 
    Among all the Seelie archfey, Dalrom cares for mortal life the least. To him, all are food for the swarm or matter to be transformed into new insectoid life. Even insectoid races like the Formian or Thri-keen fear him, offering him sacrifices rather than oblations to keep his gaze from falling on them, lest they too be devoured and repurposed.
