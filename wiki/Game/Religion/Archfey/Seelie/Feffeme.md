Description: 
    A unique visage among the ever changing Fey, Feffeme is the epitome of the feminate force. She is the paramount exemplar of feminity and fertility. Her appearance is loveliness personified as an enchanting beautiful woman in a gown of ever shifting flower petals. The delicacy of her skin more so than that of any petal; her motion is like the dancing of winds. 

History/Relationships:
    The embodiment of Spring, new life, and the fertility of the fullness of time; Feffeme is patroness of flowers and all beautiful plantlife. Defenseless, she resides in the home of her father Gaiel and oft makes appearances in the Seelie Court to advocate for vigilance in the protection of all growing beauty.
