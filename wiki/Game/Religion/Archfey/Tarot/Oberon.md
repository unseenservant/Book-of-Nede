Description: 
    The undisputed Emperor of all the Fey, and First among the First. Appearing like a elf with skin like fine pale stone and white hair like sunlight. This magestic Lord rules the House of the Tarot alongside his wife and eternal lover, **Morgana**. He is often clothed in a simple yet elegant tunic and wears a Crown of first starlight to have touched the First World. His glittering sword of judgement *Ringil* always rests at his hip. 

History/Relationships:
    Oberon is the first being of the First World. Eldest and primarch of all Nature created by the absentee Overgod. In his earliest days, when he beheld his sister Morgana he chased her throughout the First World like a panther stalks it's prey. After finally catching her, and forcing himself upon her, he retrained her for an eon or more. When she could resist his charms no longer, he freed her and married her in the first wedding ceremony. Where she tore out his right eye and cast it into the eternal seas of their world. He said to all his guests that it was worth all the pain to have her and he vowed never to seek out his eye as long as she remains with him. 

    The pair has had countless children, but the most important of which are **Ternlan** & **Adana**, who went on to found the Seelie & Unseelie courts. 
    
Dogma: \
    Like all Archfey - Oberon cares nearly nothing for the plights of Mortals who are so fortunate to have world of their own. He requires little of his followers, and gives to them freely his power to use as they see fit. His only strictures are that they care for the natural order of their world. Though what *exactly* that means is interpreted differently by each of his servants.
