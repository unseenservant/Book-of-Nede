Description: 
    The Empress of all Fey, is the embodiment of capricious fury in all nature's beauty. The at-first-reluctant wife of Oberon, has endless raven-black locks of ever flowing hair on flawless pale stone skin, as if the finest porcelain. Her eyes are bottomless wells of hatred, fury, and mourning. For in the abusive captivity of Oberon she has lost the very thing that means most to a wild Fey - freedom. Though she eventually came to "love" her captor and through him rise to a height of power hitherto unknown except by perhaps the Overgod itself; she bides it all with an unspeakable sorrow. She carries the dagger she used to pry her husband's right-eye from it's socket on their wedding, *talesin*, which is black as night traced with fractures of white arcing power. 

History/Relationships: \
    Sister of Oberon and second born of all creation, she awoke into a world unformed. Without knowing her brother she danced and frolicked in the wildlight. Until he saw her and became enthralled by her beauty - where he chased her throughout their earliest world. When he caught her, took her, imprisoned her, it was as though she had died each day for an eon. For she was the first of all things to be caged; to be without freedom. Each day Oberon tortured her with his *love* and each day she resisted his advances only to suffer at his hands. When eventually, her hatred consumed her - she came to love him back. Of her own volition she agreed to marry him and be eternally his - to be close enough to him ***to bring ruin*** upon all other things he held dear. 

    They were married in the first wedding, in the sight of their many children & the gods. The pair has had countless children, but the most important of which are **Ternlan** & **Adana**, who went on to found the Seelie & Unseelie courts. In front of them all, she tore out her groom's right-eye; and vowed that for her love, one day she would destroy all Oberon had ever witnessed and then claim his second eye before the end of all things. 

    From her husband's side, she has presided over the death of trillions, bringing unhinged ruin upon countless more. 
    
Dogma: \
    Like all Archfey - Morgana cares nearly nothing for the plights of Mortals who are so fortunate to have freedom of their own. She requires nothing of her followers, and gives to them freely her power to use as they see fit, bringing them by its use ever closer to their own destruction. She often greatly empowers her servants only to withdraw her gifts at a time that will cause as much suffering as possible. Many still take her as their patron; willing to sacrifice many in their thirst for vengeance.
