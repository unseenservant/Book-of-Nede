# The Kingdom of Omerad 

Ruled by the Royal family of the Omer from their seat in the city of Emhrais west of the Cairndal valley the Kingdom rests at a time of peace. 

The rule of **King Retfaer Emhyr IV** is a just and fair one. He has seen Twelve years on the throne and since the end of **Last War of Fjenst** Six years ago the lands of the Omer have prospered. 

The Kingdom is bordered by 3 neighbor nations. The Kingdom of Besogad to the West - a land of stout men, beautiful women, and shaggy great horses. The Kingdom of Naest to the North-East across the sea, home to odd but honest folk and many dwarves.  To the south lay the Queendom of Fjenst - a prideful and haughty land of untrustworthy Lords. The Queendom has just lost a great war where they attempted to conquer the lands of Omerad, and many Omeran men were killed defending their homes

## History

The Kingdom of Omerad is found in the transitory lands between 2 different penninsulae and the crossroads of continents. One of the uttermost nations in **The Northlands**, it has always been dominated by the jagged mountains that sever its landscape into small valleys. 

The tundral landscape of this part of the north was once home to some of the great strongholds of the **Age of Titans** and in their glory were unassailable defenses against the **Colors of Cold**. It's remote and frigid clime made it an ideal place for the Titans to fortify against the more populace Goblin hordes in the equatorial regions to the south. 

By the end of the **Age of the Slaad** the region had been abandoned from the razing the forces of chaos had wrought. Leaving it's ancient subterranean caverns a luxurious and open estate for the Dwarven rise to power. 

Dwarvish culture has flourished in the Northlands and especially Omerad ever since - giving rise to one of their greatest cities, **Silverroot**. 

Though the area was ravaged so cleanly by the **Age of Orcs** that few testaments to the Dwarven supremacy remain on the surface. 

Humans have dwelt in the valleys of the Northlands for thousands of years - initally just under the watchful eye of the Dwarven Primarchs; and the iron foot of the Orcs. 

Since **the Founding** however, the Goddess Luxi had brought her great host through these lands to cleanse the Orcish menace. Establishing order and setting many young human lords up to found kingdoms of their own in the cold mountain vales. 

Since that time, dozens of human kingdoms have risen and fallen.

### Recent History 

In the past 400 years, The human Kingdom of Omerad was established in these transitory lands by the remnants of an even more ancient (now) defeated kingdom. 

Formed by a coalition of lordlings representing different and vanquished tribal identities, the chiefs elected a High King to rule over them. This unification lead to a prosperous return to power and cohesion - leading to an establishing victory that settled their territorial challenges. 

Within the last 200 years, the line of Emhyr has claimed the Omerad throne; he and his descendants have gone on to win and lose several wars against their bitter rivals to the south **Fjenst**. 

In the last 50 years, there have been several wars with **Fjenst** as the expansionist Queendom pressures northward for further conquest and the precious metals of the Omeran mountains. 

A total of 6 wars have been fought in the last 50 years; **the Last War** taking place only 6 years ago (from campaign start)

## Culture

> **<u>Note</u>**: 
> Omerans are loosely based on Danish culture from the 12th century on Earth. Expect Burgomeisters who serve; Jarls who serve; the King. 

Ancestor/Hero worship is common, and only secondary to the worship of the gods that protect Omerad - Saxon, Russo, the elven gods: Sehanine, Aeharad, Rillifen and the Dwarven gods: Gjeddin, Njarberra and Jard. 

The **King of Omerad** is crowned in a religious ceremony by a priest of Saxon. The enemy of Omerad are the gods Sahaelis and Venecus.  Their greatest rival is the Queendom of Fjenst to the south. 

The **Jarls** have great power over their lands - so much so that the King has little actual political power beyond the loyalty & sense of nationalism of the people he rules. Each hold (territory) of the Jarls has slightly different laws than the rest of Omerad. 

The Sea/Ocean is viewed by Omerans as dangerous, and the mountains as places of safety.Many dwarven clans share the mountains with Omeran humans, as well as two prominent halfling tribes 

Omeran men wish to die a "good death" in defense of their family or Jarl/King. Omeran women wish to avoid dying in childbirth. Dying in an unpreferred way is seen as evidence that the person will not pass into the afterlife. The Omeran afterlife is believed to be a paradisical valley of lush green trees, wide fields of endless crops, and homesteads with one's ancestors.
