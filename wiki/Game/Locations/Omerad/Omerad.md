# The Kingdom of Omerad 

Ruled by the Royal family of the Omer from their seat in the city of Emhrais west of the Cairndal valley the Kingdom rests at a time of peace. 

The rule of **King Retfaer Emhyr IV** is a just and fair one. He has seen Twelve years on the throne and since the end of **Last War of Fjenst** Six years ago the lands of the Omer have prospered. 

The Kingdom is bordered by 3 neighbor nations. The Kingdom of Besogad to the West - a land of stout men, beautiful women, and shaggy great horses. The Kingdom of Naest to the North-East across the sea, home to odd but honest folk and many dwarves.  To the south lay the Queendom of Fjenst - a prideful and haughty land of untrustworthy Lords. The Queendom has just lost a great war where they attempted to conquer the lands of Omerad, and many Omeran men were killed defending their homes

## History

### Recent History 


## Culture

> **<u>Note</u>**: 
> Omerans are loosely based on Danish culture from the 12th century on Earth. Expect Burgomeisters who serve; Jarls who serve; the King. 

Ancestor/Hero worship is common, and only secondary to the worship of the gods that protect Omerad - Saxon, Russo, the elven gods: Sehanine, Aeharad, Rillifen and the Dwarven gods: Gjeddin, Njarberra and Jard. 

The **King of Omerad** is crowned in a religious ceremony by a priest of Saxon. The enemy of Omerad are the gods Sahaelis and Venecus.  Their greatest rival is the Queendom of Fjenst to the south. 

The **Jarls** have great power over their lands - so much so that the King has little actual political power beyond the loyalty & sense of nationalism of the people he rules. Each hold (territory) of the Jarls has slightly different laws than the rest of Omerad. 

The Sea/Ocean is viewed by Omerans as dangerous, and the mountains as places of safety.Many dwarven clans share the mountains with Omeran humans, as well as two prominent halfling tribes 

Omeran men wish to die a "good death" in defense of their family or Jarl/King. Omeran women wish to avoid dying in childbirth. Dying in an unpreferred way is seen as evidence that the person will not pass into the afterlife. The Omeran afterlife is believed to be a paradisical valley of lush green trees, wide fields of endless crops, and homesteads with one's ancestors.
