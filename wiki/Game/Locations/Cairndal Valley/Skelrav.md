## Description: 
An old stone ruin of an ancient temple or fortress belonging to some forgotten civilization. The ruins locals call "Skelgrav" is a taboo for the people of the valley below. However, foolish children still make dares to go up and touch one of the pillars - which still bares the weight of the mighty structure overshadowing the village below. Thoughout its recorded history, the upper levels of the ruin have been home to some visiting monsters; ranging from goblin tribes to deadlier things. Though the ruins lower levels have never been explored to anyone's knowledge. The upper pillars and walls are reported to have eerie symbols and strange busts visibly etched deep into the granite that forms the walls and structure.

## History

Built in the Age of Titans by a fringe group of Phaerimm sorcerers in pursuit of greater powers to defeat the goblins. These foul mages found the emissary of **Zh'Ash, The Man in the Mist** - the **The Cordyceps Mound**. The Fungal Lord possessed the sorcerers and used them to build a great Cathedral to Zh'Ash where the Fungal Lord could fester, and better serve it's Eldritch Master's goals. 

Great Evil poured forth from the Cathedral Spire at the heart of the mountain for generations of men, corrupting the land and consuming all life to it's will. 

Eventually, when the Titans and wider Phaerimm had conquered the Goblins, the fungal menace was discovered. At first the Phaerimm were determined to conceal the foul work of their possessed brethern from the Titans, and with their dark magics scoured the land clean of the infection. Building a laboratory atop the Cathedral Spire that served as both a containment for the infection, and a place to study the mound's Eldritch power. 

However, as the Phaerimm began to make use of their eldritch discoveries - eventually the Titans were made aware of this trouble in the north. So they came with a great Host and battled the Phaerimm for control over the unholy site. The Phaerimm were defeated, but not before successfully setting great wards - sealing the Laboratory below from the Titans. 

So the Titans set their artisans to construct a great ring that surrounded the whole area; imbued with their greatest cleansing power - that should the Phaerimm ever return to their lab - the evil within could not again pervade the whole region. 

So it remained, for many eons, until in the Age of Elves and Dwarves, Elven Necromancers with their **Soul Singing** heard the call of the **Cordyceps Mound** from within the twice seals Cathedral. 

These Elves turned to the Witchcraft of **Zh'Ash, the Man in the Mist** and foresaw the plan of the Fungal Lord to bring his Eldritch Master into **Zaede** physically. The Elves built a temple to this dark messiah of death atop the Laboratory, and styled it with evil reverence. From here, they worked for many centuries to undo the the Phaerimm's seals. Having some minor success in penetrating it, they worked out **a key** that would allow them to enter the Lab and return, but they could not devise a way to penetrate the deeper seals and enter the Cathedral beneath. 

Eventually, the wickedness of these Elves brought a sickness and death once more to the valley and surrounding regions. Which lingered as a place of doom and fear by the time the Age of Orcs had begun. 

When the Founding came, Luxi's army - on it's purge northward of the Orcish menace found the sick valley. The goddess of light entered with her host the dark temple of the ancient Elves; and placed upon it a seal of her own power - not knowing the dark purposes of what lay beneath.
