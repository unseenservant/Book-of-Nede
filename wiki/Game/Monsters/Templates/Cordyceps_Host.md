## Speed: 
As base creature

## Special Abilities: 

Spread Zh'Ash (Su): 
```
    As a melee touch attack, a Cordyceps Host can transfer fungal spores from its own body to that of an opponent. The spores can be washed away with a single flask of holy water, or by full immersion in any liquid. On the host's next action, the target must succeed at a Fortitude Save (DC 12), failure means the spores have been absorbed into the target's flesh and they've contracted Zh'Ash's gift (see below).
```


Zh'Ash's Gift (Su): 
```
Any creature hit by a Cordycep Host's Spread Zh'Ash attack that fails the Fortitude contracts this supernatural disease. The incubation period is 1 minute, and the disease deals 1d2 points of Charisma damage per round until the afflicted creature reaches 0 Charisma, at which point the fungus has taken control of the creature's brain. These effects manifest as rapidly rotting flesh and dementia. An afflicted creature gets only half the benefits of natural and magical healing, though a cure disease effect removes the affliction. While the spores are inside the victim, a remove curse or remove disease effect destroys it curing the victim, and a dispel evil or neutralize poison effect delays its progress for 10d6 minutes. A creature will become a new Cordyceps Host 1d6+4 rounds after being reduced to 0 Charisma by this disease (gaining this template). Once a creature has reached 0 Charisma, The spores have successfully replaced subtantial portions of the victim's brain, and the disease is no longer cureable by any means, save Wish or Miracle. 

The disease will continue to deal 1 point of intelligence damage per day, on a failed Fortitude save (DC 12). At 0 intelligence the creature will undergo a further transformation into a Cordyceps Majoris.

Newly created Cordyceps Hosts are joined to the will of the Cordyceps Mound and behave as if under a possession effect. The new Cordyceps Host is not dead, when a PC becomes a Cordyceps Host, you as the GM should take control of the PC’s actions. 
The Cordyceps fungus possessing the creature has access to all of the base creatures abilities and can imitate their mannerisms flawlessly if it so desires. A successful DC 25 Sense Motive check can reveal that the creature is behaving oddly, but not more than that.
