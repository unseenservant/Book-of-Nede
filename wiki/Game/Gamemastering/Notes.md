## Chapter 2 

### Schlecter Stein
A brilliant but disgruntled academic whose theories are correct - though no one believes him.
Like a nazi scientist, enamored with studying foul topics; he tortured, dissected, bound a familiar of **Rot** into his blackblade. 
Schlecter wants to use the **Tablet of Asthenia** and **The Book of Nede** to open the path into the depths of *Skelgrav* where he can release **Zh'Ash**. 
His **BlackBlade** however, works for the **Cordyceps Mound**, who does not want the **baby-Zh'Ash** to be released, but wishes to absorb it's spirit - becoming free of it's bounds to the Elder God. 
Unknowing of the difference between the master's it serves - **Schlecter** has been allowing Cordyceps fungus to infect himself and his followers; unintentionally ensuring their servitude to **the Mound** instead of **Zh'Ash** himself. 

Schlecter remembers where in the *Underdark* he found the **Book of Nede**, which was an *ancient Goblin Colony* 
## Miscellaneous 

### Dikkori, Brother of Hikori 

A Monk of dedicated to an Order with foresight; foresaw the events in Emhrais regarding **Calaran**. 
He left **Sihnon** to journey to the west, to stop the merger, though he did not know exactly where he was bound to. 
When arriving in *Tier*, he made his way north crossing the **Sterile Lands**. When he eventually arrived in Heinburg, because of the war, he had to *pawn his Kama* to afford passage into Omerad. 
Sadly, without his Kama, he was less than able to deal with **Mistletoes** and ultimately got captured. 
But not before sending a letter back for his sister **Hikori** to warn her.
