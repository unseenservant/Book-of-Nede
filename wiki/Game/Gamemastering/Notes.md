### Dikkori, Brother of Hikori 

A Monk of dedicated to an Order with foresight; foresaw the events in Emhrais regarding **Calaran**. 
He left **Sihnon** to journey to the west, to stop the merger, though he did not know exactly where he was bound to. 
When arriving in *Tier*, he made his way north crossing the **Sterile Lands**. When he eventually arrived in Heinburg, because of the war, he had to *pawn his Kama* to afford passage into Omerad. 
Sadly, without his Kama, he was less than able to deal with **Mistletoes** and ultimately got captured. 
But not before sending a letter back for his sister **Hikori** to warn her.
