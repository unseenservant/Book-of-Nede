# Chapter 06 - Shadow over Emhrais 

## Homunculi Umbrae

- Ambition (the strong, silent guy)
- Lust (the sexy chick)
- Selfishness (the creepy guy)
- Haughtiness (the kid)

## Simulacra everywhere 

The **Homunculus Selfishness** has been creating Simulacra of powerful creatures from Wax for years, and when the new moon appeared he had the power to draw on to bring life to them all. 

The goal to be, to see if *shadowstuff* can substitute for *lifeforce (positive energy)* in living things. 

## Illusuory Excess 

Mistletoes, in an experiment to exercise the power of the **Moon of Calaran** has conjured forth an immense amount of *shadowstuff* to generate *nearly real illusions* of ships, animals, cargo, food, and even sentient beings. The ritual used to generate these things and the effect relies upon the shadow of the **Moon** resting over Emhrais to give false life to these illusions. But as long as it does, they are nearly as good as real. 

The people are overjoyed at the abundance of food and nourishment suddenly available to them and are gorging themselves on the shadowstuff creations. This is not sustenance, and so they are rapidly becoming malnourished and starving. 

However dire this is, the **Church of Luxi** is not blind to the starvation of the masses and especially not the malnourishment of her crusaders camped in and without the city walls. Her clerics are creating true food daily to supply real nourishment and **Luxi herself** is preparing to determine the cause of this fabrication and put and end to it herself. 

# The Cause

In the bowels of the **Waxshop** are some tunnels that lead through the ancient halls beneath Emhrais proper from the time of **the Founding** to a point at the bottom of the well in the center of the city. 

It is here, in this archaic chamber that Mistletoes experiment upon the moon is generated from and his ritual conducted. 

**Several Druids** are emprisioned here in *pocket-dimensions* of shade, on the border between the Plane of Shadow and the Material Plane. Their *lifeforce* & *green-magic* fueling the ritual that gives the semblence of true life to the Simulacra in the Waxshop and the many illusions roaming Emhrais. 

These captured druids are but a small fraction of the illegally seized druids being held against their will by Mistletoes elsewhere in the city's dark underbelly.
