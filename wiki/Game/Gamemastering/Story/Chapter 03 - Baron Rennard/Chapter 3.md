# Chapter 3

#### Summary: 

## Adventure Background

### What the Public Knows
**Baron Rennard Drynhart** began as a long forgotten relative of the **House of Dryn**. A famed house for its loyalty to the Crown in Emhrais & it's steadfastness against the barbarians & expansionist Fjenstans to the south. 

*Rennard* was living in Fjenst for years before it was determined that he was the last surviving heir when **the Last War with Fjenst** was nearing its end. 

He was a little known defector from Fjenst and his obligatory call back to his inheritance suited him little. 

Until one day. 

Rennard had a complete change of additude 

He saddled up. 
Set his arms at his side, and provisioned himself for war. 

When Rennard arrived, he immediately found the Fjenstan army had progressed into the valley of his inheritance 

He heft a greataxe, **Hellrime** and fought to defend his family's land against the Fjenstan incursion

With the war eventually done the Barony was proclaimed his again in victory. And he was welcomed into the court of Emhrais

### The Truth

When the young and ineffectual Rennard Drynhart received word to come and claim his inheritance during **The Last War**, he was not the only one. A young Red Dragon **Skylrax** was hiding among the foppish Baron's court. When the notice of inheritance came - the Dragon seized on the opportunity. Slaying & Devouring the young baron in the night; he assumed his guise once and for all. 

He then rode forth boldy to claim "his" inheritance and has pretended to be the Baron ever since. 

All was well until **Quaker Mistletoes** was travelling the region as part of a census effort. The shrewd and magically adept gnome was able to easily discern that the Baron was deceiving everyone. So, in the spirit of **Calaran**, the gnome approached **Skylrax** to blackmail the Dragon; pressganging him into the Gnome's service. 

The relationship between Dragon and Gnome has been a strained one - where **Skylrax** chafes against being manipulated. However, the dragon has tolerated it to his own financial gain. 

#### The Barony of Cairndal 

Baron Rennard rules over a territory that incompasses the villages of Cairndal, Afsdal, the Castle Frederiksborg, several unnamed thorps, as well as **Chateau Drynhart** along with a small thorp outside it's walls. 

For *most* of his reign, the Barony has been ruled under an iron fist. Taxes are levied -frequently- and the citizens are kept just above the barest poverty. The closer townships to the Dragon's Chateau are oppressed even further, with citizens travel being restricted or completely prevented. The larger villages of Cairndal & Afsdal enjoy relative freedom from the Baron via his puppet Burgomeisters; and are able to afford the sizeable taxes because of the dwarven trade from Silverroot. 

The Castle of Frederiksborg is officially under the control of Emhrais directly, and **Quaker Mistletoes** uses it as a check on the Dragon's political sphere. However, the castle sits on an unceded plot of land and is *rented* by the government from the Barony; giving the Dragon a considerable amount of influence over the castle, though not direct command. 

With the events of Chapter 1, **Baron Rennard Drynhart** is extremely skeptical of the PCs. Their affiliation with the Druids, successful delving into Skelgrav and their possession of a fate-born child have unnerved the Dragon. 

His plan is to harass them politically, shake down their loved ones, and force them from his lands or break them into submission. His goal is to abduct **the baby** to hostage, forcing the PCs to submit to him, or failing that - a female PC (Hikori before the wedding?). 

He knows his Chateau is virtually a fortress - and his draconic lair built into the caverns running behind his home makes any assault against him unlikely to succeed. In case, he keeps seige-breaking equipment in his stables (large catapults, and crates of blackpowder). As well, he keeps a band of mercenaries on his payroll that lives in the Chateau. These mercenaries make life for the villagers living on the Chateau's grounds even more miserable than the Dragon alone does. They are constantly abusing, raping, and exploiting the villagers for their own benefit. 

## Story 

### Background 
For the last 42 years, **Skylrax** in the guise of Baron Rennard Drynhart has chafed under the authority of **Quaker Mistletoes** in secret. The gnome has held sway over him, showing himself to be a powerful political benefactor, and of uncontendable magical might for **Skylrax** to overcome. 

So, adding it all as just one more facet of the role he plays pretending to be the Baron, **Skylrax** acts the part of a noble doing the bidding of his feudal lord. 

In recent days, unbeknownst to the Dragon, **Mistletoes'**s plan has progressed significantly, achieving the proof-of-concept in bringing **Calaran's Moon** to the Material Plane, a significant cult from Heinburg has come sniffing around his territory killing and terrorizing his serfs, a *fateborn* child was born on his doorstep, and the *druid's circle* has evaporated into thin air, the goblins and orcs have been roused from the deep, and a band of would-be heroes has been causing chaos in his quiet lands. 

All of this has put **Skylrax** on edge, he fears something is coming to threaten his position, and his instincts tell him that **Mistletoes** can no longer be trusted. 

This has made him paranoid; even more prone to harsh punishments upon his serfs that in the past. 

When the PCs departed so mysteriously from **Cairndal**, they had exhumed **Lysanne Montagu's** body from its grave. This gave **Skylrax** the clue he needed to piece together large pieces of the puzzle. Moreover, the scraps of Lysanne's Diary that had been given to **the Burgomeister** illuminated for him the purpose of the cult. 

So he took Lysanne's body and through some simple magical exercises, worked out her lineage. When he realized she was of royal blood, he found an opportunity to introduce a little chaos to the otherwise unfathomable purposes driving his lands out from under his iron-clawed rule. 

He hired some miscreants (ironically, **Last Laugh** guild members belonging to the very cult he sought to investigate) to retrieve **Ulrich** and **Sybill** **Montagu**, after they failed to respond to his ransom letter for their daughter's body. 

His plan being, that once they were apprehended, they could be ransomed back to the King of Fjenst for a hefty sum, or bartered with to kick start a new war of conquest from Fjenst - where he could betray **Mistletoes** in favor of a dukedom within Fjenst. 

### The Adventure

When the PCs return to **Cairndal valley** they'll find it's villages under severe oppression, Baron Rennard ekeing every last penny out of them in tax money - new sheriff's beating or imprisoning resistors. 

The Baron's chateau is a fortress and it will take all of the barony's might to rise up and throw off the shackles of their oppressor. 

The PCs will have to move from faction to faction, enlisting their aid to form an Army capable of over-throwing the Baron. 

The Baron also has a few aides of his own, powerful NPC commanders who support him and will need to be incapacitated if the villagers are to have any chance at winning.
