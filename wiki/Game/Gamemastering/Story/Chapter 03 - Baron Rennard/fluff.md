# Additional Chapter 3 Fluff

## Hellrime

The ancient Axe of the Drynhart family, an evil and accursed thing rarely used because of the disturbing visions and ill-fortune it brought it's bearers. The Axe is actually forged of Stygian Steel, and once belonged to **Thalonika, Grand General of the Legio Furae Infernus of the 33rd Spire of Gehenna**. **Thalonika** won Hellrime off a legion from the 99th spire who had originally forged the weapon, that fled the field during her invasion of the Material Plane ages ago. Thalonkia chose to leave it on Naede as an avenue to tempt mortals. 

However, because of her claim on the blade -- the Moon Hag **Yvette** was able to use it as a focus to *Gate* **Thalonika** and imprison her for the **Dragon Skylrax**.

## Why all the Hell-themed stuff? 

Claiming the Drynhart Axe 'Hellrime', Skylrax was contacted by the Contract Devil for the 99th Spire (the creator's of the Axe) and offered an Infernal Pact. The Dragon, always eager for power agreed -- but in exchange for his very valuable dragon's soul negotiated a great boon as part of the deal. He would be given the dedicated service of a Devil-worshipping Hag Coven, lead by **Yvette**. As time and the bargain wore on, the clauses in the Pact became ever more burdensome for Skylrax and eventually he sought a way out of the deal. However, though the Hags were at his service they would not betray their patron (the 99th Spire), so he sought another way. The Axe *visions* had revealed belonged to **Thalonika** (see above) and she being a powerful commandant in Gehenna may be able to exercise some power over Skylrax's Pact. 

Using the Coven's power, many soul sacrificies, and Hellrime as a focus -- **Thalonika** was called forth from Gehenna to be bargained with. However, she could not be convinced to intercede on the Dragon's behalf (they simply couldn't "deal" with a Devil that powerful). So they decided to leave her there to stagnate until she agreed to aid them. 

Devils are nothing if not obstinate, and even the long life of Dragons and Hags means little to the eons **Thalonika** could endure. 

## The Golem 

Skylrax, in personally excavating the bowels of Chateau Drynhart to suit his draconic purposes -- discovered (and promptly ruined) a small Dwarven settlement in the bedrock beneath his manor. The Dragon also quickly discovered a Stone Golem left over from the Dwarven collapse; and after much battling, gained it's service via a *control rod*. 

The Golem is from the Age of Leaf and Stone and was primarily built as a settlement guard for the (now ruined) **settlement of Gaduzel** in the earliest years of the Age of the Orcs.
