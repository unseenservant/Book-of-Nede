# Eriadstor

## Background

A Movanic Deva of the **Solemn House of Triumph** , Eriadstor has conducted numerous solo tours of the Negative Energy Plane. He is a warrior, with a warriors heart and has spent eons battling in the preservation of life. 

One ill-fated day he pursued from afar, an Atropal in a distant realm into **Aizonthan**, while he lost sight of the abomination; he discovered a sobbing creature in the oppressive caverns. Believing it to be a lost soul in need of shepherding, he diverted from his course and came upon **Confratae**. The Daemon did not recoil at his holiness, but *slyly* implied that she was forlorn for the demise of a mortal. Movanic Deva's are not typically of the mind to detect deceit - preferring straight forward foes - Eridastor was ill-prepared to defend against the demure of a weeping maiden. Cautiously he chided her as a Daemon unfit for love, but **Confratae** convinced him of a great prejudice against her; and that she would ever languish apart from life and love herself through no fault of her own. 

She seduced Eridastor in the Halls of the Dead, and though he was duty bound to his mission - he would return to her frequently over the eons for trists in the dark. 

It was during these times, that **Confratae** implored him to see her vision: 

A Future where none would be separated from their loved ones, where consciousness and 'life', in a sense, could flourish eternally. A Future where Zh'Ash the Great Old One consumed **Aizonthan** and broke the Great Seal. 

To aid this future, where Eridastor could be with **Confratae** his supposed beloved, Eridastor aided a mortal named **Lysanne Montagu**, in perfecting the ritual embodiment of Zh'Ash into a mortal baby.
