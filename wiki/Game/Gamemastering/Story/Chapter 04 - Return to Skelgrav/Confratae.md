# Confratae || Corbett Skjarsson

## Brief History

**Corbett Skjarsson** was a half-elven warrior raised in a northerly village near **Kausokova**. Having journeyed to **Emhrais** to follow Luxi's crusade and save the living, this young elfling is brave, stalwart and caring. 


## Physical Description

With uncut *chesnut hair* delicately framing his *stoic jawline*, his *piercing green-eyes* shine forth like emeralds in the sunlight. He is *tall* of build and *muscular* while remaining slender, as his resolute pectorals crown his cobbled abdominals. 

His breeches reveal strong thighs and the buttock of a rock climber at home in mountainous terrain like the Valleys of the north. 

With **Confratae** possessing him, she has used her magic to transmute his gear and attire to match the 'vibe' she is going for. That of a cleric of Venecus who has come to Cairndal to undo a prophetic vision. His garment is winter appropriate and comely without being ostentatious. His apparel signals that he is a prepared adventurer and came equipped. **Confratae** had even journeyed into Cairndal village to procure all the healing items she could purchase to ensure she has enough to truly help the party. 

He wears his (un)holy symbol of Venecus openly, but in position around his unbuttoned traveller's shirt for quick concealment when in populated areas. For arms, he carries a Scythe (venecus's favorite weapon) & wears a [light] hide armor of furs.

### Notes 

It's a plausible story -- and knowing she can likely hide from any *detection* effects, Corbett's alignment-neutral standing makes him an excellent candidate for her deception. 

The story is that Corbett had recevied a vision via *divination* that a great danger to the land would arise within Cairndal valley -- and that **Venecus, the God of Death** wished for Corbett to stave off this calamity. So he journeyed here from **Kausokova** to tackle the coming threat. 

In reality, Corbett's humble demeanor and sincere affect are just a ruse. The Erodaemon has every intention to seduce, deceive, and connive the PCs into giving her the Skullcandle of Eriador and enabling her to break the seal on the Cathedral Spire

She adds **+ 29** to Bluff checks, and an additional **+10** on checks made to persuade that she is, in fact, Corbett Skjarsson


## The Poor Soul

**Confratae** chose this poor soul to be the subject of her possession for his beauty and fairness. Once in control of his mind, she has probed his memories and broken his spirit to gain unfettered access to impersonating him. 

She adds **+ 27** to hide from effects that would detect her as an Evil Outsider, and can *ride* poor Corbett through even *Forbiddance* effects. Corbett cannot pass the saving through to resist the possession except on Nat 20s , so even if he receives *protection against evil* ; he'll likely still be under Confratae's influence.
