## Adventure Background

### Ancient History
Built in the Age of Titans by a fringe group of Phaerimm sorcerers in pursuit of greater powers to defeat the goblins. These foul mages found the emissary of **Zh'Ash, The Man in the Mist** - the **The Cordyceps Mound**. The Fungal Lord possessed the sorcerers and used them to build a great Cathedral to Zh'Ash where the Fungal Lord could fester, and better serve it's Eldritch Master's goals. 

Great Evil poured forth from the Cathedral Spire at the heart of the mountain for generations of men, corrupting the land and consuming all life to it's will. 

Eventually, when the Titans and wider Phaerimm had conquered the Goblins, the fungal menace was discovered. At first the Phaerimm were determined to conceal the foul work of their possessed brethern from the Titans, and with their dark magics scoured the land clean of the infection. Building a laboratory atop the Cathedral Spire that served as both a containment for the infection, and a place to study the mound's Eldritch power.

The Phaerrim used their lab to exploit the **Cordycep Mound**'s arcane abilities to infest and control organisms and combined it's eldritch abilities with their own understanding to create several horrors: 

- The ***Arcano-Organic Virus** a spore-like plague that virulently consumes a living host transforming them into a mindless thrall of the Phaerrim.
- The Hive, a race of arcano-organic monsters with a *supernatural* hive-mind that propagates via a terrible infestation process. 
- the Ahamkara Centipedes; near-godly powerful Puppeteers created via replicated goblinoid magick and the **arcano-organic virus** to be implacable weapons of mental dominance that can control the Goblinoid menace.

While the **arcano-organic virus** created in of the Laboratory was never released into the wider world; the Hive and the Ahamkara Centipede's both escaped before the Cathedral Spire was eventually sealed when the Titans came to challenge the Phaerrim. 

As the Slaadi menace eventually emerged in the late Titanic Age - the Phaerrim were forced to abandon their lab -- giving the evils residing therein time to propagate. 

Eons later, the Laboratory levels were sealed away by the Luxite crusaders when they came north purging the Orcish menace from the lands. 

The *light barrier* still holds in place over the main entrance and the Elven cult were never able to penetrate the *goddesses* magic. 
### Recent Times

The PCs had encountered the Ahamkara Centipede that still resides within the Laboratory -- it had remained hidden all these eons including from the Luxite crudsaders. However, it did not expect to become *trapped* by the light barrier. 

It's only hope of exit -- and freedom from the
