# The Arcano Organic Phage

## Historical Context 

At the close of the **Age of Bats**, the Phaerrimm, Titans and Dragons were gaining the upperhand. The three great races' magical might overthrowing the Elder practices of fleshwarping and the Eldritch knowledge of goblinkind. 

As the goblin numbers diminished, their vesperic empire collapsing and the *great races* establishing their own realms; many goblins were captured in the wars of their downfall. The Dragons, desiring dominion; claimed them as slaves -- the Wyrms using what they could learn of *goblinoid arts* they crossbred them into the subserviant draconid Kobolds. 

The Titans also captured goblins but having no purpose in the mutation of flesh sought to purge the Goblin menace forever by creating the <u>**Malavespera**</u>; a holy and wrathful curse laid upon all who share in the blood of the bearer. The Titans took great pains to *atone* the goblins in their captivity and once convinced to bear the *Malavespera*, were released back into the vestiges of their collapsing civilization to intermingle with their kin -- spreading the goblins perpetual doom. 

The Phaerrim however, saw great potential in the *goblinoid arts*. The Phaerrim, convinced of their own Arcane supremacy, viewed the Elder knowledge and Eldritch power of the Goblins as another great tool the goblins had misused or failed to appreciate. 

... Long after the goblins had completed dissolved, Phaerrim sects continued to relearn the *secrets of **Ly'Khan***.


## Origins 

Atop the umbral Cathedral Tower built by an exiled sect of Phaerrim in *worship of rot*; the **Noocratic Phaerrim** eventually came to the area which would be known as Cairndal Valley to put an end to their splinter sect's heretical worship. 

In the Cathedral, the **Noocratic Phaerrim** discovered great horrors and greater knowledge -- the power of *cordyceps* to repurpose, change, and maintain life. The also discovered the **Cordyceps Mound**, though they were even not strong enough to withstand the avatar's incredible might. So they sealed it away -- sending the cipherkeys far off to their capital; whilst establishing a laboratory facility atop the Cathedral. 

Wherein, they began to migrate preserved goblins and Phaerrim sages in *the goblin art* to conduct experiments of fleshwarping mixed with *cordyceps*. This was a time of great strife between the civilizations of Phaerrim and Titan, and the dark magisters were looking for an upperhand which could overcome their foes resiliences. 

What yielded up from their abombinable experimentations they hailed as triumph -- but history would remember with trauma. They created a phage, a lamentable disease, which they called the <u>**Arcano-organic Phage**</u>. An inert substance appearing like parchment ash, it is actually a virulently enchanted substance that will infect a living host. After the disease runs it's course, the visceral run-off coalesces into an ooze-like entity of singular intelligence; which violently evacuates the host. To spread anew... 

## Effects

### <u>Arcano Organic Phage</u> 
#### <u>Type</u>
disease, inhaled, virulent, ravaging, magic-resistant, plague; 
#### <u>Save</u> 
Fortitude DC 31
#### <u>Onset</u> 
1d3 hours; 
#### <u>Frequency</u> 
1/hour
#### <u>Effect</u> 
1d4 Con damage; as long as a character suffers Con damage from Arcano Organic Phage, he is fatigued.
#### <u>Cure</u> 
2 consecutive saves
#### <u>Special</u>: 
Remove disease can’t cure the Arcano Organic Phage, and even more powerful spells such as heal require a successful caster level check with a – 10 penalty (DC = the disease’s save DC) to remove the Arcano Organic Phage.

If the Arcano Organic Phage deals ability damage, each time the affected creature fails a saving throw to resist the Arcano Organic Phage’s effects by 5 or more, 1 point of that ability score damage becomes permanent ability score drain instead. If the affected creature rolls a natural 1 on a saving throw to resist the Arcano Organic Phage’s effects, all of the ability score damage becomes permanent ability score drain.

If the Arcano Organic Phaged creature fails two consecutive saving throws, it is sickened until the next time it succeeds at a saving throw to resist the Arcano Organic Phage’s effects. If the diseased creature fails four consecutive saving throws, it is nauseated until the next time it succeeds at a saving throw to resist the Arcano Organic Phage’s effects. These penalties are in addition to any other effects of the Arcano Organic Phage, and cannot be removed as long as the creature remains diseased. Even if the creature is normally immune to the sickened or nauseated condition, that condition still applies; only immunity to diseases protects against gaining the condition from a virulent Arcano Organic Phage.

The Arcano Organic Phage responds violently to any attempts to heal it using magic. Whenever the diseased creature is subject to a spell or ability that cures diseases, it must succeed at a Fortitude save or suffer the Arcano Organic Phage’s effect. This does not reset the Arcano Organic Phage’s frequency, and succeeding at this check does not count toward the number of consecutive saves required to be cured of the disease.

The Arcano Organic Phage can affect creatures that have Constitution scores and are <u>normally immune to disease</u>, whether that immunity comes from a racial trait, class feature, spell, magic item, or other source. However, such creatures receive a +4 bonus on saving throws when attempting to resist the Arcano Organic Phage’s effects.

The Arcano Organic Phage is an inhaled disease, a creature afflicted with the Arcano Organic Phage creates an aura of disease around it. Any coughing, sneezing, and in some cases, even breathing releases clouds of Arcano Organic Phage-causing organisms into the air. Any creature that comes within 30 feet of the diseased creature is exposed to the Arcano Organic Phage, and must succeed at a Fortitude save or begin suffering its effects. A potential victim must attempt a new save each time it moves within 30 feet of a diseased creature, to a maximum of one saving throw every 10 minutes. Any creatures that remains within 30 feet of the diseased creature must attempt a new saving throw every 10 minutes. 

### The Hive Larvae

When a creature finally dies from, or even if they have suffered any CON drain from the Arcano Organic Phage at all when the disease is cured/resisted. A terrible larval creature is created inside them. Possessing Ooze-like qualities, this intelligent being is the progenitor of a race of beings the Phaerrim have termed **'The Hive'**. 

If the host dies, the Larvae will quietly and disturbingly evacuate the host's corpse and seek out a new organism to infest. The corpse is still virulent with the AOPhage for 1 week and may begin this terrible cycle if someone comes within the disease's inhaled range. 

If the host is alive and resists/cures the AOPhage successfully, if it has suffered even a single point of CON drain from the disease's *ravaging* quality when it shakes off the disease, that means a Larvae born of the creature's bloodloss has successfully been able to form. The creature now automatically (no save) counts as <u>infested(ex)</u> by the Hive Larvae and 1d4 minutes later will fall unconscious as per [The Hive Larvae's](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/aberrations/hive/hive-larva-swarm/) ability of the same name. 

If the larvae formed by the AOPhage is able to successfully mature inside a host (whether the original victim of the disease, or a new host post-evacuation) the resulting Hive specimen will always be a new **Hive Queen**. 


## The Hive 

### Hive Larvae
A Hive Larvae Swarm is an ooze-like creature. An amorphous or mutable conglomerate of independent but unified constituent creatures. In this case, the constituent creatures are fine sized bloodworms formed from the AOPhage runoff. 

Hive Larvae Swarms have both the [swarm] and the following traits of an [ooze]: 

- Not subject to critical hits or flanking. Does not take additional damage from precision-based attacks, such as sneak attack.

### Notable Abilities 

When any Hive creature is killed, the Larval Swarm *still exists* inside it, and will re-emerge from it's destroyed carapacean body to find a new host to infest. To permanently kill it, the swarm must be reduced to 0HP after it has emerged from the fullygrown Hive form. 

### The Pale in the Mindscape

When the Phaerrim created the Arcano Organic Phage, and gave birth to the first hive creatures, they *blessed* the Hive with a disembodied unified consciousness called <u>**The Hive Mind**</u>. This powerful esoteric entity exists within a mindscape the Phaerrim created and gave it mastery over. The Hive Mind is intelligent, capricious, and every bit as arrogantly willful as it's creators; and it can telepathically communicate with any Hive creature or larval swarm across the **Inner Planes**. 

The Pale, as it is called in recent ages, grows more powerful in a region the more Hive forms are present. For every 20 Hive forms that are gathered within a 1 mile radius, *Teleportation* magic becomes disrupted. Spellcasters are able to sense this disruption when attempting to cast effects with the [Teleportation] descriptor, and may choose to cancel the effect or risk proceeding. If they proceed, they must make a caster level check DC 36 or lose the spell as if they had cast it. Other conjuration spells are not affected, and spells from other schools than conjuration with the [teleport] descriptor are likewise not affected. 

The Pale's influence bleeds through from it's mindscape pressing on the planar boundary with the Astral plane in areas where many Hive forms are present - resulting in this 'smothering' effect on [teleportation] magic.
