Special Abilities:
  Object of Desire: |
      While using its detect thoughts ability, 
      an erodaemon can see into the mind of a humanoid 
      and identify the person the target most desires, 
      whether it be a lost loved one or an object of lust. 
      As a full-round action, the erodaemon can change into the 
      form of this desired person as long as the target is a 
      Small, Medium, or Large humanoid. The erodaemon gains 
      a +20 bonus on its Disguise and Bluff checks to impersonate 
      that person and avoid being detected as a fraud, 
      but spells like true seeing negate this effect as 
      normal. This effect ends if the erodaemon attacks 
      any creature. Actions that could reveal the erodaemon 
      as a fraud (such as performing an action that 
      the imitated person would obviously not do, 
      like cast a spell or speak Infernal) require the 
      erodaemon to make an immediate Bluff check to 
      continue the impersonation, with the erodaemon 
      losing some or all of its bonus depending on the 
      severity of the breach (GM’s discretion).
  wilting kiss: |
      An erodaemon can draw a mortal into a state of 
      obsession with its kiss. An unwilling victim must 
      be grappled before the erodaemon can use this 
      ability. A creature affected by this kiss must 
      make a DC 23 Will save or become obsessed with 
      the erodaemon, an obsession the erodaemon feeds 
      on. Each round the target is more than 30 feet 
      away from the erodaemon, it must make an 
      additional DC 23 Will save. Failing the save 
      means that the sheer pain of her absence deals 
      1 point of Charisma drain to the subject that 
      round. Succeeding at the Will save two consecutive 
      times ends the effects of this ability. Spells 
      such as dispel magic and break enchantment end 
      this effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.
Class Features:
  Ur-Priest:
    - Rebuke Undead
    - Divine Spell Resistance 15
    - Siphon Spell Power: |
        Because they steal whatever power they can, 
        ur-priests learn to manipulate their energy in
        ways that confound other casters. An ur-priest 
        of 6th level or higher can temporarily sacrifice
        two (or more) lower-level spell slots and use 
        those slots to prepare a higher-level spell. 
        The higher-level spell must be of a level the 
        ur-priest can cast. Only one exchange of this 
        sort can be made each day. The levels of the 
        lower-level slots are totaled, then reduced to 
        three-quarters (round down) to determine the 
        level of the extra higher-level spell slot. 
        For example, an ur-priest who sacrifices a 
        3rd-level spell and a 5th-level spell can use 
        that spell slot to prepare an additional 6th-level
        spell (3 + 5 = 8, and 8 × 3/4 = 6).
