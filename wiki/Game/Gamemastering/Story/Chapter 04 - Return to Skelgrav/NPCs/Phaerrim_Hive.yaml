Special Abilities:
  - Implant (Ex): |
      As a standard action, an adult or older 
      phaerimm can use its stinger to lay eggs 
      inside a paralyzed creature. The young 
      emerge about 90 days later, literally 
      devouring the host from inside. A remove 
      disease spell rids a victim of the eggs, 
      as does a successful DC 20 Heal check made 
      by a character with ranks that skill. 
      If the check fails, the healer can try again,
      but each attempt (successful or not) deals 
      1d4 points of damage to the patient.
  - Poison (Su): |
      Stinger, DC 15 Fortitude save; 
      initial damage paralysis for 2d4 rounds, 
      secondary damage paralysis for 1d3 hours. 
      Paralyzed creatures levitate, helpless, 
      a few feet off the ground.
  - Spells: |
      A phaerimm casts arcane spells as a sorcerer
      (caster level equals phaerimm's character 
      level). Phaerimms use their sorcerer spells 
      as if they were spell-like abilities, so they 
      require no verbal, somatic, or material 
      components.
  - Detect Magic (Sp): |
      Beginning as a hatchling, a phaerimm can 
      use detect magic at will (caster level equals 
      phaerimm's character level).
  - Flight (Ex): |
      Because a phaerimm's body is naturally buoyant, 
      it can fly at a speed of 30 feet. This buoyancy 
      also grants the creature a permanent feather 
      fall effect (as the spell) with personal range.

  - Full Vision (Ex): |
      As it ages, a phaerimm's natural ability to 
      detect magic expands. A juvenile phaerimm can 
      see invisible or ethereal creatures to a range 
      of 120 feet, as though under the effect of a 
      see invisibility spell. An adult phaerimm 
      constantly can see magical auras to a range of 
      120 feet, as though constantly under the 
      effect of an arcane sight spell. An elder 
      phaerimm sees as though constantly under the
      effect of a true seeing spell.
  - Telepathy (Ex): |
      A juvenile or older phaerimm can 
      communicate telepathically with any 
      creature within 100 feet that has a 
      language.
