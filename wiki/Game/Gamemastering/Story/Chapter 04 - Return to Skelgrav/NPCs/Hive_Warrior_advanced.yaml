  Acid Spit (Ex): |
    A hive warrior can spray acid as a ranged 
    touch attack out to a maximum range of 20 feet. 
    Creatures struck by this spray take acid damage 
    as if struck by a hive creature’s death throes.
    Additionally, creatures damaged by a 
    hive warrior’s acid spit continue to take the 
    same amount of acid damage for the next 1d3 
    rounds. A successful Reflex save halves the 
    initial damage and negates the ongoing damage.

    The save DC is Dexterity-based.

  Rending Blades (Ex): |
    When a hive warrior confirms a critical hit 
    with its boneblades, it deals equal damage to 
    the creature’s armor.

  Boneblade: |
      This Medium-size slashing melee weapon is 
      considered masterwork (adds +1 to attack roll) 
      and deals 1d10 points of damage. It is 
      bone-white with thin red and blue veins 
      covering its sides.

  Extra Armor: |
      Extra chitinous plates are fitted to the 
      hive warrior's body, adding +2 to its existing 
      natural armor bonus.

  Mouth Launcher: |
      This weapon, which attaches to the back of a 
      hive warrior's mouth, looks like a worm with a 
      sphincterlike mouth. As an additional attack
      made at the hive warrior's highest attack bonus, 
      the mouth launcher can shoot out at a foe, 
      making an improved grab attack that deals 
      1d4 points of damage (plus the hive warrior's 
      Strength bonus). If it gets a hold, the 
      foe is pulled into the hive warrior's mouth 
      for an automatically successful bite 
      attack on that same round. The mouth 
      launcher continues to hold the foe, allowing 
      automatic bite attacks each round until the 
      foe breaks free. Add +1 to the Challenge 
      Rating of a hive warrior with this weapon.

  Corrosive Blood (Ex): |
      A hive creature’s blood is highly caustic. 
      Every time the hive creature is damaged by a 
      piercing or slashing weapon, the attacking 
      creature takes acid damage according to the 
      table below (or double damage if the attack 
      is a critical hit). Using a reach weapon does 
      not endanger the attacker in this way. If the 
      hive creature has the swallow whole ability, 
      it adds this damage to its swallow whole 
      damage.

      Size of Hive Creature	Points of Acid Damage
        Medium or smaller	1d4
        Large	1d6
        Huge	1d8
        Gargantuan	2d6
        Colossal	2d8

  Death Throes (Ex): |
      When a hive creature dies, it exudes a pool of 
      its corrosive blood in the space it occupies. 
      This pool deals 1d6 points of acid damage per 
      Hit Die of the hive creature for 3 rounds to 
      objects and creatures in those squares 
      (Reflex half ). This acid damages whatever 
      surface it is on, and if it deals enough damage 
      to destroy the surface, the acid falls down to 
      any subsequent floor below and continues to deal 
      damage. The save DC is Constitution-based.

  Heat Adaptability (Ex): |
      Hive creatures are considered to always be 
      under the effect of endure elements with 
      regard to hot climates.

  Hive Mind (Ex): |
      Hive creatures have no language of their own, 
      instead communicating simple concepts via 
      pheromone discharge and body language that other 
      creatures with the hive subtype understand. 
      This ability functions within line of sight. 
      If one hive creature is able to act in the 
      surprise round of combat, all other hive 
      creatures in line of sight can also act, and a 
      hive creature isn’t flanked unless all hive 
      creatures within line of sight are flanked.
