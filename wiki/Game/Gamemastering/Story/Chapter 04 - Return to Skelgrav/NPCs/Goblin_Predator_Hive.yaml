Special Abilities:
  Acid Spitter: |
      This handheld weapon makes ranged touch attacks with a range 
      increment of 10 feet and a maximum range of 50 feet. Those 
      struck by the glob of acid take 10d6 points of damage. It bears 
      a vague resemblance to a repeating crossbow, although it has a 
      bulbous green membrane attached to its top. The acid spitter 
      can be used 10 times per hour.
  Extra Armor: |
      Extra chitinous plates are fitted to the kython's body, adding 
      +2 to its existing natural armor bonus.
  Phase Organ: |
        This small fleshy pod fits upon the forehead of the kython, 
        grafting into place permanently. It allows the kython to 
        become incorporeal (or corporeal again) as a free action. 
        It cannot use this supernatural ability more than once per 
        round. Add +1 to the Challenge Rating of a kython with this 
        device.
