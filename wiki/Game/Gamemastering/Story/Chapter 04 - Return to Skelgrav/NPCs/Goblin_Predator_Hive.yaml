Special Abilities:
  Acid Spitter: |
      This handheld weapon makes ranged touch attacks with a range 
      increment of 10 feet and a maximum range of 50 feet. Those 
      struck by the glob of acid take 10d6 points of damage. It bears 
      a vague resemblance to a repeating crossbow, although it has a 
      bulbous green membrane attached to its top. The acid spitter 
      can be used 10 times per hour.
  Extra Armor: |
      Extra chitinous plates are fitted to the kython's body, adding 
      +2 to its existing natural armor bonus.
  Phase Organ: |
        This small fleshy pod fits upon the forehead of the kython, 
        grafting into place permanently. It allows the kython to 
        become incorporeal (or corporeal again) as a free action. 
        It cannot use this supernatural ability more than once per 
        round. Add +1 to the Challenge Rating of a kython with this 
        device.
  Ancient Goblins: 
    Blood Incorporation (ex): |
        Whether by their Bite attack, or licking the blood of their 
        foes off their claws. The goblin can incorporate the natural 
        attacks, extraordinary abilities, movement types, special 
        abilities, and special qualities of any living corporeal 
        creature. If the creature is also non-extraplanar, their 
        supernatural abilities are also incorporated. The goblin 
        grows extra limbs to accomodate new natural attacks, or 
        limbs appropriate for new movement modes. The goblin 
        immediately develops the necessary anatomy to replicate the 
        extraordinary abilities. The goblin treats these incorporated 
        abilities just as if they were its own racial traits. These 
        traits persist indefinitely, unless the Goblin chooses to 
        abandon them. A goblin's size category never changes  as the 
        result of this ability. Weaknesses or Immunities that are a 
        result of the target's [Type] are never incorporated. 

    Blood drain: as Vampire 1d4 CON / +5 Temp HP

  Corrosive Blood (Ex): |
      A hive creature’s blood is highly caustic. 
      Every time the hive creature is damaged by a 
      piercing or slashing weapon, the attacking 
      creature takes acid damage according to the 
      table below (or double damage if the attack 
      is a critical hit). Using a reach weapon does 
      not endanger the attacker in this way. If the 
      hive creature has the swallow whole ability, 
      it adds this damage to its swallow whole 
      damage.

      Size of Hive Creature	Points of Acid Damage
        Medium or smaller	1d4
        Large	1d6
        Huge	1d8
        Gargantuan	2d6
        Colossal	2d8

  Death Throes (Ex): |
      When a hive creature dies, it exudes a pool of 
      its corrosive blood in the space it occupies. 
      This pool deals 1d6 points of acid damage per 
      Hit Die of the hive creature for 3 rounds to 
      objects and creatures in those squares 
      (Reflex half ). This acid damages whatever 
      surface it is on, and if it deals enough damage 
      to destroy the surface, the acid falls down to 
      any subsequent floor below and continues to deal 
      damage. The save DC is Constitution-based.

  Heat Adaptability (Ex): |
      Hive creatures are considered to always be 
      under the effect of endure elements with 
      regard to hot climates.

  Hive Mind (Ex): |
      Hive creatures have no language of their own, 
      instead communicating simple concepts via 
      pheromone discharge and body language that other 
      creatures with the hive subtype understand. 
      This ability functions within line of sight. 
      If one hive creature is able to act in the 
      surprise round of combat, all other hive 
      creatures in line of sight can also act, and a 
      hive creature isn’t flanked unless all hive 
      creatures within line of sight are flanked.
