## In-Game Instructions 


### Releasing Zh'Ash from a mortal form into the Material Plane
- must be in a mortal
- must be on the material plane
- mortal's soul must be subscribed to the Tablets of Fate 
- hypostatic bond is very strong, killing the mortal will release target into outer-planes; therefore, body and soul must be integrated to become an Outsider[native]. 
- Outsider[Native] type change can be achieved in multiple ways; but to have true success it must be permanent. *Reincarnation* doesn't work *great* as it +/- wipes the *soul*. 
    - Level 20 Monk, or other Capstones
    - *Ritual of Renaming* is best bet. 
    > Note:  
    > Device in Skelgrav was prepared by Zh'Ash worshipping Elves to facilitate this ritual.
