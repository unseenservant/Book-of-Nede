## Adventure Background

**Schlecter Stein** was enrolled by his parents at a young age in the Heinburg University. An institution that had professional sages as well as expert academics covering every field of natural philosophy and the magical arts. A talented student of the arcane, arithmetic and other philosophies, **Schlecter Stein** was always drawn to the Occult. When he wasn't acing his exams, or impressing his professors with intellectual prowess - he was pouring over Occult reliquaries and delving in to the mysterious powers of Patronage. 

His research lead him to some dark conclusions - eventually culminating in his petition to fund an expedition to Underdark of the Sterile Lands. His propsal was accepted, on a paupers budget he set off (mainly on his own magical means) to pursue his quest. The **Grimoire of Tasha the Black**, a text of an ancient land which pre-dated **The Founding**. **Tasha the Black** was a sorceress who lived in an ancient land now covered by the sterilization which followed **The Founding Wars**, she allegedly drew her purportedly significant magical might from a deal with an ineffable Patron, and her powers - from all of **Schlecter Stein**'s research - indicated his thesis might be true. 

That the Arcane and the Occult are one and the same power. 

After he returned triumphant, he sought to use his groundbreaking understanding of magic to gain for himself the powers of **Tasha the Black**. Try as he might though, he could not make contact with a Patron - or perhaps no Patron would treat with him. So he turned to less dignified means. He *acquired* a local witch who was condemned for dark magic; and stole her Familiar. 

It was a vessel for some Patron, **Schlecter Stein** knew that much for certain, but who and what remained a mystery. So he peeled back the magical layers of the Familiar, uncovering the occult roots of it's connection to the beyond. Try as he may, he could not bind the mysterious patron to himself, no matter how he *plucked* at the tethers binding the Familiar to the entity's service. 

So he did the next best thing. Leveraging his understanding from the Grimoire, and his *dissection* of the Familiar, he bound all that it was into a Blade using the Arcane arts he had mastered - and by arduous process - re-wrote all the occultic magic into Arcane spells. His labores succeeded. The Familiar's spirit was bound into a **Black Blade**, which itself was a fragment of **Schlecter Stein**'s own will & a mixture of whatever Patron had empowered the Familiar it was bore from. His spellcraft exceeded all his expectations - and he was able to cast via Arcane magic, the power of Witchcraft. 

Now, his intelligent blade, revealed to him the secrets that only it had access to. It served **Zh'Ash, The Lord of Rot**, and **Schlecter Stein** would be his instrument, whether The Rotlord was willing to accept him or not. 

He founded a cult to **Zh'Ash**, attracting at first lonely and misbegotten students from the Unviersity; but with an evil shrewdness, he expanded and glorified his death cult into an "exclusive club" for socialites and nobles across Heinburg. 

In his Order's advancing Degrees, only the most trusted would be immersed into the Occult power of **Zh'Ash** that **Schlecter Stein** had revealed. The lesser members served to bankroll the organization or give it sociability. Eventually, as his cult's practices grew ever darker, they drew the attention of an equally villanous entity: **Xardox, The Beholder**. 

**Xardox** had come to Fjenst nearly a decade before **Schlecter Stein** was born and had infiltrated the ancient Sewers of Heinburg from it's now ruined home in the **Underdark of the Northlands**. The last of it's city, **Xardox** brough his cruelty, malice, and avarice to the city of menfolk - assembling a Guild of talented and vicious theives in his service; **The Last Laugh**. Through this Thieves' Guild, **Xardox** eventually plans to take his best recruits back into the Underdark and retrieve the buried treasures belonging to his now eradicated people. 

When **Schlecter Stein** made contact with the monster, both wicked creatures saw an opportunity. Through **Schlecter Stein**, **Xardox** would gain access to needed magical aide and could exploit the cult's unwittingly wealthy elite members for plunder. In **Xardox** and his thieves, **Schlecter Stein** found a ready source of laundered income, a way to further fund his own efforts - and one that bore fruit. 

For **Xardox** knew of and aided in the retrieval of, **The Book of Nede** from a catacomb deep in the sweltering underdark. For **Schlecter Stein**, this was proof that **Zh'Ash** was approving of him - and for **Xardox** this was proof that the Underdark could be raided successfully by surface dwellers. 

With **The Book of Nede**, **Schlecter Stein** set into motion the events of Chapter 1, the ritual that impregnated Lysanne Montagu; and embodied **Zh'Ash** himself into flesh. In the months leading up to Lysanne's birth, **Schlecter Stein** had been forging ahead on his plans to unleash **Zh'Ash** himself into the world. His cult -- his society -- would lead a revolution in the name of **Zh'Ash**; bringing the Elder God in his true form to the world. Such a thing would only be accepted if the people of the world had something *greater* to fear that **Zh'Ash** could save them from. So, he conjured forth a Leukodaemon; and entered into an arrangement with it. It would be given nearly free reign to spread death and pestilence throughout the land and claim all the souls that perished from its virulence. In exchange, it would teach **Schlecter Stein** to understand Disease and this most terrible plague that it brought -- a Shang illness called by some "The Black Death". Then by the time this plague had spread far and wide, the baby would come to term & they would venture forth using another ancient tome **The Tablet of Asthenia** to penetrate into the depths of Skelgrav and release their lord into the world. **Schlecter Stein** would be a hero to both his god & to the world for bringing about an end to the plague. 

However, Lysanne is now dead, the babe Elder God missing, and **Schlecter Stein**'s most devout servants perished in the north. So what's a devoted cultist of the Lord of Rot to do - he must retrieve the baby and **The Book of Nede** or else all shall be lost and his plans will crumble.  

To that end he has been tracking the **The Key** and scrying on the Party. He has learned they are ignorant of the child's heritage & not prone to heroics. Without the **The Babe** there will be no one who can control the Leukodaemons pestilence. But **Zh'Ash** it seems, has brought them to him -- for they have come to the city without prodding or provocation to aid one of their own and are poking around searching for his cult. He will lure them, the baby and the **Book of Nede** right to him, kill them and set himself back on track. 


## Story

With the **Key** to **the Book of Nede** in their possession, the PCs will inevitably open it. When they do it reveals the indecipherable notation of **Sigilmetry**, and some of the most powerful form of that magic the PCs will ever encounter. Use of the Book or its magic is quite beyond them, even basic instructions and notations are in geometric-diagramatic form. **The Book of Nede** will be needed later in the campaign, but the PCs may try to locate an expert in **Sigilmetry** to help them decipher it's power. 

| Knowledge (Esoterica) | Result | 
| --- | --- |
| DC 10 | Sigilmetry is a form of magic where the forces at play are described in mathematics and geometry diagrams. Those who use this **Ancient** form of magic are called Geometers. |
| DC 15 | the practice of Sigilmetry is very ancient, only seen in a rudimetary form in *Glyph* & *Symbol* spells. **Ikkar** mages, **The Wisemen of Finzelzin**, & perhaps the University at **Heinburg** are the most likely places to find knowledgable scholars on Sigilmetry |
| DC 20 | Sigilmetric forces underpin the power of many magic schools; Summoning circles, Abjurative diagrams, the **Symbol** & **Glyph** Spells. But their power comes from describing (or changing) the fundamental properties of reality. To be a master of Sigilmetry is akin to being a master of **True Names**. The **Book of Nede** is a collection of the most powerful Sigils, because this legendary book describes the world of Nede itself. |
| DC 25 | **Sigilmetry** has diagrams to represent other plans as well, and can equally affect those outer realms. **The Book of Nede** is so profound, because it has descriptions of all the planes, not just the material plane. | 

The DC 15 knowledge check should be enough to have the PCs realize that they could get information about the **Book of Nede** in **Heinburg**; which is where they need to go to pursue the **Mistmen** lead. 

Much of this adventure is going to be the journey from the quiet vale of Cairndal to Heinburg. While the PCs are free to choose any path they wish, some options are: 

- Overland, on their own
- Overland with a Halfling Caravan or Merchant crew
- By sea 
- By the Deep Roads out of Silverroot (though this option will likely result in a Part Wipe)

However they travel, the PCs are being scryed on by the **Key** to the book. The Scryer is the **Head of the Mistmen** in **Heinburg**; **Schlecter Stein** and he's scrying on the specific PC that killed **Vin Einder**. Roughly aware of their plans from his observations - **Schlecter Stein** is going to bend all his resources toward recovering the **Book of Nede**, it's **Key** & **The Baby**.

#### (New) Key Items 

- **The Tablet of Asthenia**: This ancient black tablet is written using the Phaerimm language but in the Elven Alphabet, encoded using a Phaerimm Cipher - and is a translation of an even older Phaerimm manuscript. It was created by the Elves of Skelgrav long ago, and details their understanding of the Phaerimm Temple beneath their feet. As it is contained on the Tablet, it details the prophecy of **Zh'Ash** coming into the world hypostatically; one day meeting with and destroying his Errant herald **The Cordyceps Mound**. The Tablet also illustrates the Elven portion of **Skelgrav's** operation and contains the details of the ritual (requiring the **Book of Nede**) to fully allow **Zh'Ash** into the Material Plane. *It can only be translated at Finzelzin*

- **Grimoire of Tasha the Black**: This book of spells contains many dark magicks (some 3.5 spells), and crosses many Witch and Wizard spells bridging the gap between the Arcane and Occult worlds of magic. **Tasha the Black** lived during **The Founding** and was a powerful Witch of **The Shadow**, in the form of **Yormungandr**. While she perished in the Wars that followed **The Founding**; her booked survived. 

- Schlecter Stein's **Black Blade**: Created by Schelcter binding the soul of a Familiar in service to **Rot**, this blade drips decative acid and has etched along its length occult markings containing **Schlecter Stein**'s spellbook. The Blade knows all his spells, but does not work for him out of choice. It works for the Witch who was imprisoned in Heinburg whose Familiar **Schlecter Stein** has stolen and bound. The Blade Cannot willingly betray **Schlecter Stein**, but it will be free if he is slain and will try to coerce it's new bearer into bringing them to Skelgrav & returning it to **The Cordyceps Mound**. 

- **Rod of Noxa**: This magic rod of Divine Power is imbued with the Darkness of Noxa and acts like a re-usable Rod of Cancellation but for spells and effects with the [Light] descriptor. It is a rare item, crafted by the Church of Noxa in the early eras of **The Founding** - but it is not *quite* an artifact. Purchase Price: 35,000gp

- **Map & "Key" to the Vault of Panoptus**: The Beholder and patron of the Last Laugh Thieves' guild brought with him when he escape his home of **Panoptus** a map on how to return, as well as the **Key** to the Vault owned by their Spawnmother. The Journey will require traveling across some of the abandoned **Deep Roads** and the PCs should be encouraged to only undertake this side-quest after at least beginning their main-quest in Silverroot.
