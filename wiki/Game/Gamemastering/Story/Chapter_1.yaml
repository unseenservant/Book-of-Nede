Story: |
  9 Months ago, [Lysanne] was the a prominent devotee of [Zh'Ash]
  the Elder God of Death. When her cult in [Fjenst] had uncovered the
  ancient tomb-city of [Vernich] and made successful exploration 
  of it - they found something terrible. The fabled [Book of Zaede], 
  a tome of the unfathomable power of creation. 

  Using this book of [Sigilmetry] their plan was to bore [Zh'Ash] into life. [Lysanne] 
  volunteered to be his vessel, and using the [Book of Zaede] became pregant with a baby. 
  As her pregnancy developed in the months that followed, she became suffered increasingly 
  from nightmarish visions of [Zh'Ash]'s plans for the world. Distraught at what she might
  unleash from her womb; she spoke with the leader of her sect, [Ven Einder] - who attempted to 
  disuade her from aborting the babe. 

  [Lysanne], feigning compliance - made plans to flee. Her research indicated that 
  [Skelgrav] in distant [Omeran] [Cairndal Valley] as a place rich with the power of [Luxi]
  might be the one place where her abortion might succeed. 

  Upon making her flight with the stolen [Book of Zaede], she was immediately pursued by 
  her former [Mistmen] cult acolytes. 

  -- 

  In Cairndal, the cult of Mistmen has no significant presence. [Ven Einder] and the few 
  cultists he brought with him in pursuit of [Lysanne] stick out as outlanders - so they 
  mostly stay in their camp hidden in the top level of [Skelgrav] on the cliffs above [Cairnpool]. 
  They had actually beaten [Lysanne] to the region, but she was able to elude them up to the 
  night the campaign begins. 

  In the few weeks leading up to the [start of the game]:
    - [Lysanne] had been hiding in Cairndal
    - 3 Children had gone missing, after wandering too close and spotting the [Mistmen] entering [Skelgrav]
    - Goblins had been initially blamed for the Children's disappearances
    - Livestock have been mutilated by [Zh'Ash] inside [Lysanne] as she passes
    - A raid was recently conducted on a nearby Goblin warren; the children had been found inside 
      (planted there by [Cairndal] guards, on the [Burgomeister's orders])
    - A Goblin survivor had been capture in the attack, and is currently being held prisoner
    - [Lysanne] was found by [Mistmen] the morning of [start of the game], and the [Key to the Book of Zaede] was stolen from her
    - [Lysanne] was only able to escape by drawing on power from [Zh'Ash] inside her
