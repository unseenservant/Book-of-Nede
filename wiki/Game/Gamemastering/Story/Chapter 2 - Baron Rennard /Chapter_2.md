## Adventure Background



## Story

With the **Key** to **the Book of Nede** in their possession, the PCs will inevitably open it. When they do it reveals the indecipherable notation of **Sigilmetry**, and some of the most powerful form of that magic the PCs will ever encounter. Use of the Book or its magic is quite beyond them, even basic instructions and notations are in geometric-diagramatic form. **The Book of Nede** will be needed later in the campaign, but the PCs may try to locate an expert in **Sigilmetry** to help them decipher it's power. 

| Knowledge (Esoterica) | Result | 
| --- | --- |
| DC 10 | Sigilmetry is a form of magic where the forces at play are described in mathematics and geometry diagrams. Those who use this **Ancient** form of magic are called Geometers. |
| DC 15 | the practice of Sigilmetry is very ancient, only seen in a rudimetary form in *Glyph* & *Symbol* spells. **Ikkar** mages, **The Wisemen of Finzelzin**, & perhaps the University at **Heinburg** are the most likely places to find knowledgable scholars on Sigilmetry |
| DC 20 | Sigilmetric forces underpin the power of many magic schools; Summoning circles, Abjurative diagrams, the **Symbol** & **Glyph** Spells. But their power comes from describing (or changing) the fundamental properties of reality. To be a master of Sigilmetry is akin to being a master of **True Names**. The **Book of Nede** is a collection of the most powerful Sigils, because this legendary book describes the world of Nede itself. |
| DC 25 | **Sigilmetry** has diagrams to represent other plans as well, and can equally affect those outer realms. **The Book of Nede** is so profound, because it has descriptions of all the planes, not just the material plane. | 

The DC 15 knowledge check should be enough to have the PCs realize that they could get information about the **Book of Nede** in **Heinburg**; which is where they need to go to pursue the **Mistmen** lead. 

Much of this adventure is going to be the journey from the quiet vale of Cairndal to Heinburg. While the PCs are free to choose any path they wish, some options are: 

- Overland, on their own
- Overland with a Halfling Caravan or Merchant crew
- By sea 
- By the Deep Roads out of Silverroot (though this option will likely result in a Part Wipe)

However they travel, the PCs are being scryed on by the **Key** to the book. The Scryer is the **Head of the Mistmen** in **Heinburg**; **Schlecter Stein** and he's scrying on the specific PC that killed **Vin Einder**. Roughly aware of their plans from his observations - **Schlecter Stein** is going to bend all his resources toward recovering the **Book of Nede**, it's **Key** & **The Baby**.
