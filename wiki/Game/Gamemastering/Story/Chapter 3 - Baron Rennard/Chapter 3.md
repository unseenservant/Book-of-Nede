# Chapter 3

#### Summary: 

## Adventure Background

### What the Public Knows
**Baron Rennard Drynhart** began as a long forgotten relative of the **House of Dryn**. A famed house for its loyalty to the Crown in Emhrais & it's steadfastness against the barbarians & expansionist Fjenstans to the south. 

*Rennard* was living in Fjenst for years before it was determined that he was the last surviving heir when **the Last War with Fjenst** was nearing its end. 

He was a little known defector from Fjenst and his obligatory call back to his inheritance suited him little. 

Until one day. 

Rennard had a complete change of additude 

He saddled up. 
Set his arms at his side, and provisioned himself for war. 

When Rennard arrived, he immediately found the Fjenstan army had progressed into the valley of his inheritance 

He heft a greataxe, Hellrime and fought to defend his family's land against the Fjenstan incursion

With the war eventually done his Barony was proclaimed his again in victory. And he was welcomed into the court of Emhrais

### The Truth

When the young and ineffectual Rennard Drynhart received word to come and claim his inheritance during **The Last War**, he was not the only one. A young Red Dragon **Skylrax** was hiding among the foppish Baron's court. When the notice of inheritance came - the Dragon seized on the opportunity. Slaying & Devouring the young baron in the night; he assumed his guise once and for all. 

He then rode forth boldy to claim "his" inheritance and has pretended to be the Baron ever since. 

All was well until **Quaker Mistletoes** was travelling the region as part of a census effort. The shrewd and magically adept gnome was able to easily discern that the Baron was deceiving everyone. So, in the spirit of **Calaran**, the gnome approached **Skylrax** to blackmail the Dragon; pressganging him into the Gnome's service. 

The relationship between Dragon and Gnome has been a strained one - where **Skylrax** chafes against being manipulated. However, the dragon has tolerated it to his own financial gain. 

#### The Barony of Cairndal 

Baron Rennard rules over a territory that incompasses the villages of Cairndal, Afsdal, the Castle Frederiksborg, several unnamed thorps, as well as **Chateau Drynhart** along with a small thorp outside it's walls. 

For *most* of his reign, the Barony has been ruled under an iron fist. Taxes are levied -frequently- and the citizens are kept just above the barest poverty. The closer townships to the Dragon's Chateau are oppressed even further, with citizens travel being restricted or completely prevented. The larger villages of Cairndal & Afsdal enjoy relative freedom from the Baron via his puppet Burgomeisters; and are able to afford the sizeable taxes because of the dwarven trade from Silverroot. 

The Castle of Frederiksborg is officially under the control of Emhrais directly, and **Quaker Mistletoes** uses it as a check on the Dragon's political sphere. However, the castle sits on an unceded plot of land and is *rented* by the government from the Barony; giving the Dragon a considerable amount of influence over the castle, though not direct command. 

With the events of Chapter 1, **Baron Rennard Drynhart** is extremely skeptical of the PCs. Their affiliation with the Druids, successful delving into Skelgrav and their possession of a fate-born child have unnerved the Dragon. 

His plan is to harass them politically, shake down their loved ones, and force them from his lands or break them into submission. His goal is to abduct **the baby** to hostage, forcing the PCs to submit to him, or failing that - a female PC (Hikori before the wedding?). 

He knows his Chateau is virtually a fortress - and his draconic lair built into the caverns running behind his home makes any assault against him unlikely to succeed. In case, he keeps seige-breaking equipment in his stables (large catapults, and crates of blackpowder). As well, he keeps a band of mercenaries on his payroll that lives in the Chateau. These mercenaries make life for the villagers living on the Chateau's grounds even more miserable than the Dragon alone does. They are constantly abusing, raping, and exploiting the villagers for their own benefit.
