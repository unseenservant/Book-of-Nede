Ven, 

I received the information you passed to me via Rennard
He has seen Lysanne in Cairndal & He will help you with your goal.

If the baby is born, Rennard and Hadrian will assist you. 
In exchange, you will assist the Goblins; help them to the surface and survive the Dwarven patrols & aid them in capturing the Druids Circle. 

Rennard will report back to me on your successes, if you ever hope to leave my domain with your precious child. 

~~ Signed, The Greve ~~
