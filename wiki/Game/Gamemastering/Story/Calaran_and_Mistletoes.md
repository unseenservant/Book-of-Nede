Quaker Mistletoes

## Long Before the Campaign

Quaker Mistletoes has lived for several centuries in the vales and mountains of **Omerad**. Long before the current kingdom was founded, he came north from the warm southlands with his small family. In the frigid north, he discovered the local Druid's circle. He was accepted for his love of nature and the druid's perceived the **gift of green** within him. For countless years he apprenticed to the Druid's until **Rollabad the 3rd, King of the Omer** called Quaker's master to court for council. The Gnome was awed by the manufactured splendor of the Palace, and became enamored with the gentle nature of Rollabad. It was agreed that Quaker should serve the **Royal Family of Omerad** as a permanent druid consultant. 

Over the decades since, Quaker's seen the passing of dear Rollabad and the rise of his children; as well as many wars with Fjenst and each other. The conflict of men and the pressing need to be useful to his patrons clued clever Quaker in to the fact that - either he assisted the menfolk in their efforts, or he would be banished from the court of Rollabad. 

Quaker decided to forgo his fondness for nature, and pursued more powerful magicks -- more useful magicks. Delving into the archives of the previous Omeran Court Wizards, Quaker began to teach himself spellcraft. Like all Gnomes he had a knack for the arcane and his druidic training gave him a flexible attitude to the rigours of wizardry. Soon he found himself the premiere wizard in the capital city, building a reputation far and wide as a loremaster, magister, and wiseman. Behind his veil of usefulness to the crown, Quaker learned the politics of the menfolk. Gaining the ear of Rollabad's descendants time and again as each came of age. With each generation, he made sure to position families loyal to the crown with titles and nobility. 

After generations of this though, his mastery of the arcane arts, his political puppeteering, and control of the capital began to tire his soul. All Gnomes must work contantly to stave off the **bleaching**, as new experiences fade into old memories, their souls weary of the drudgery of the mundane. 

With all of Quaker's learnededness - and his soul beginning to bleach, he sought a way to stave it off. 

## Shortly Before the Campaign

Quaker Mistletoes was beginnging to bleach and this sparked in him a determination to stave it off. He knew from his druidic days, his long memory, and the stories of old: that Gnomes were originally from **The First World**. This meant that, fundamentally, he was a spirit that in the long ago had chosen to embody itself in the material of this world that was *foreign* to him. 

He uncovered a secret, that there was in ancient scrolls, a Fey Lord that had cautioned the Gnomes against their choice - who loved them and wished them not to abandon their true home. 

A Fey Lord named **Callaran**. 

It took Quaker nearly one-hundred years to discover, decipher and delve into the forgotten depths of Naede to find it. An item belonging to **Callaran**, a thing of myth -- wrought in an Age of the Great Powers long long ago. 

A ring, like a golden crescent moon, with dark sylvan runes etched masterfully into its flawless surface. **The Last Ring of Callaran**. 

The Gnome donned the ring immediately, afixing it to his ear like an earing. When he heard the **Shard of Callaran** speak to him from within the ring.

When Quaker returned from the deep places, he was a changed Gnome - transformed in spirit and knowledge by the power of **Callaran**. Within renewed purpose, **Callaran** told him of the ever-changing nature of the *First World* and it's wild nature being a comfort and sustenance to the Gnomes. **Callaran's** solution, merge the first world and Naede so the Gnomes (and all Fey) would not suffer.
