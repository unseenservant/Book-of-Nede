## Descriptions

### Positive Energy Plane
### First World
Before **Az'Arot** touched the World of Naede, the First World was the Material Plane. It was a realm of pure nature, set up by the Deities. After **Az'Arot** touched it, the Material was divided from the Spiritual; the First and unending from the Last and finite. 

Now the First World is a primeval and emotional realm of nature spirits left over from the harsh division that ended their natural bliss. Chaotic, wild, and capricious. It is the home of Fey.

### **Material Plane**
8 Known Planets of the Material Plane: 
- **Ylon**: Closest to the Star, a terrestial planet of boiled rock and heat blasted iron. 
- **Hygiea**: A planet of violent storms that is mostly oceans of mercury. Completely inhospitable. Second from the star.
- **Nede**: Main planet of the campaign setting, earth-like. 3rd from the star. 
- **Aegas**: A temperate terrestial planet, rotates at 90` of the plane. Regarded as a "garden world". 4th from the Star. 
- **Syne**: A terrestial frozen world with intense ash clouds from runaway volcanic activity. 5th from star.
- **Sorae**: An frigid ocean world of methane seas with terrestial archipelagos. 6th from the Star. 
- **Pallas**: A glittering gem of an massive stellar geode that has been cracked open like an egg. 7th from the Star. 
- **Serec**: A frozen gas giant of gargantuan proportions, islands of terrain float in the hydrogen/helium medium. 8th planet.

### The Seven Heavens, Solymn (Good)

Situated at the cosmological apex and nearest the Positive Energy Plane, Solymn is bathed in the sonorous glory of life. Divided by congress into seven realms (called heavens) by the Celestial Spirits each is a nearly complete fractal of **Perfection** honed to a singular point. Harmony is the order of the day, and the Spirits who dwell here hail from cooperative **Tribes** each ruled diversely yet in community with each other. 

**Angels**, **Azatas**, **Agathions**, **Archons** but not the exiled *Fifth Tribe*; have dominion over the Seven Heavens. With the notable exception being **Athonrous**, which is the great occulant arch from which Positive Energy flows into the cosmos.

### <u>The Great Tyranny, Gehenna (Law Evil)</u>

Gehenna is a bleak plane that sits closest to "good" among all realms of evil. It is a place of tyranny and contrivance, it's realms are *desolate by design* - the scouring of the plane manufactured by it's masters; the Devils. The Devils are an expression chosen by fallen Celestial spirits. These same "fell" choosing a dark path to combat dark foes. They have made **Gehenna** a bulwark against the **Daemons** and **Demons** who lie 'beneath' them. Spread throughout the desolation of their own making are 64442 Spires of *Cold Iron*; each responsible for maintaining the defense from the planes that lay **even lower** than Gehenna. 

The Devil's have organized themselves into an extremely heirarchical military bureaucracy using fundamental constants of ***Order*** to empower themselves and **Gehenna** itself against the endless hordes of the lower planes. They draw upon the power of **Ordo, the Eternal Seal** to accomplish this - and it's shadow can be seen permeating Gehenna. 

The chief warlords of Gehenna are the Infernal Archduke's (see below), who worship their Magister Primarch **Asmodeus** who dwells within the Ruby Fortress at the center of Gehenna. 

8 Known Planets of Gehenna: 
- **Avernus**:      analog of **Ylon**, ruled by **Bel**
- **Dis**:          analog of **Hygiea**, ruled by **Dispater**
- **Minauros**:     analog of **Nede**, ruled by **Mammon**
- **Phlegethos**:   analog of **Aegas**, ruled by **Belial**
- **Stygia**:       analog of **Syne**, ruled by **Levistus**
- **Tartarus**:     analog of **Sorae**, ruled by **Glasya**
- **Maladomini**:   analog of **Pallas**, ruled by **Baalsebul**
- **Cania**:        analog of **Serec**, ruled by **Mephistopheles**

### The Ravenous Dark, Apollyon (Chaos Evil)
Beneath **Gehenna**, passing beyond the waning influence of the **Eternal Seal** you reach the last place of Light from the Positive Energy Plane. A immense chasm yawning open to the depths that seems heave like the diaphragm of the cosmos itself! The Abyss, the Great Maw, or **Apollyon** the Destroyer is a realm home to the *Second Form of The End*; Demons - spirits not born of Positive Energy. 

Apollyon has a dank dampness to it, *abyssal moss* and vile fungi cloy to most surfaces across this plane of evil drinking up the last light of the Positive Energy Plane. No one knows how deep Apollyon goes, or from whence the Demons come - but they are endless. Eternal effulent of the **Primordial Chaos** beneath them, they are the Spirits of material Destruction - bent on the annihilation of all order and matter. Only the strongest spirits survive here, and for the Demons that means Demonic Lords have risen as warlords; only their power preserves their station - and a single mistake will send the Lord's rulings into a power vaccuum. 

Their realm lies in shadows, cast by the *last light* mixing with the *Great Fangs of the Maw*, giving the Demons only a taste of *true life* - just enough to whet their appetites. 

No one has plumbed the unceasing ever twisting depths of Apollyon, but we know eventually it births out into **Pandemonium** 

The Demons and their kin are eternally caught in a two-front war. Above them, blocking the way into the higher planes are the Devils - while below them are the soul devourers, the Daemons.
### The Primordial Chaos, Pandemonium (Chaos)

### <u>The Endless Desolation, Abaddon (Neutral Evil)</u>
Far beneath **Gehenna**, well beyond the **Light of Life** you come to the darkest desmense. A realm of desolation unending, lifeless craggy peaks exaggerate the landscape - if one could see them. For Abbadon is beyond all *light*, and there is only darkness eternal. This is the realm of the Daemon - these are the soul devourers, the unliving spirits of ravening. They are the heralds of the **End of All Things**, they are *The First Form of Death*. Lead by the **Four Horsemen** greatest spirits of Death.  

The Daemons, know not the faintest taste of the **Light of Life** and so hunger for souls above all other desires, the cessation of a living soul is the sweetest sensation for a Daemon. And so while the **Horsemen** plot their great revelation, the lesser Daemons flit like shadows into Gehenna or delve through secret paths that lead past the **Eternal Seal** into the **Halls of the Dead** where they may feast unchecked. 

None from the living world have charted the full breadth of **Abaddon**, but it is known the **Horsemen** dwell within mighty fortresses called *Chariots*, rumored to be hewn of *unliving stone*.
