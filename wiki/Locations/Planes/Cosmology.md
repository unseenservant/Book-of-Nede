## Descriptions

### Positive Energy Plane
### First World
Before **Az'Arot** touched the World of Naede, the First World was the Material Plane. It was a realm of pure nature, set up by the Deities. After **Az'Arot** touched it, the Material was divided from the Spiritual; the First and unending from the Last and finite. 

Now the First World is a primeval and emotional realm of nature spirits left over from the harsh division that ended their natural bliss. Chaotic, wild, and capricious. It is the home of Fey.
