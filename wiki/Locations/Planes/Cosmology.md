## Descriptions

### Positive Energy Plane
### Astral Plane
### The Seven Heavens, Solymn (Good)

Situated at the cosmological apex and nearest the Positive Energy Plane, Solymn is bathed in the sonorous glory of life. Divided by congress into seven realms (called heavens) by the Celestial Spirits each is a nearly complete fractal of **Perfection** honed to a singular point. Harmony is the order of the day, and the Spirits who dwell here hail from cooperative **Tribes** each ruled diversely yet in community with each other. 

**Angels**, **Azatas**, **Agathions**, **Archons** but not the exiled *Fifth Tribe*; have dominion over the Seven Heavens. With the notable exception being **Athonrous**, which is the great occulant arch from which Positive Energy flows into the cosmos. 

As **Solymn** sits above **The Eternal Seal**, the celestial Spirits are not bound by the strictures confining the lower planes. They are free to defend the cause of life, spread throughout the cosmos and combat evil wherever it may dwell.

### The Eternal Seal,  Ordo (Law)
**Ordo** is a realm of Spirits and the *genesis of the material*. It is a cleanly structured domain of perfect time and mechanical grace. The Spirits who dwell here are the **Axiomites**, and in ages long past, they were the tools through which the Gods worked their creations into being. **Axiomites** relish the completion of tasks, the fulfillment of orders to perfe*ction and the humility of obedience. So since the earilest days their great forges fused the elements into existence and their bands gave firmament to the cosmos. 

As their great age came to it's disastrous end, and their works were disrupted or remade over and over again - the Axiomites forsaw their own nature as the cause of yet future calamities. So one of 2 last acts of true creation, they built of their own wills: new spirits - **The Inevitables**. Living Constructs whose sole purpose is the violent enforcement of Order, maintenance of the firmament and obliteration of transgressors. 

The other of their *last acts* was the setting of the **Eternal Seal**, a structure of unparalelled esoteric power, that it has become synonymous with **Ordo** itself. The Eternal Seal is a perfect alignment of the 8 planets in Ordo such that the Sign of Censure Against Death is created and projected across the Cosmos by the *light of life*. This powerful combination censures the power of Negative Energy throughout the middle-planes, and upsets the *Great Balance* to preserve their creations both mortal and immortal. The Seal also acts like a prism, dividing and refocusing the power of *the light of life* to drive essence of the middle-planes. The planes of Fire, Water, Air, Earth and Ether are sustained in perpetuity by the power of the **Eternal Seal**. 

However immensely powerful the Seal is, it is not omnipotent. It's lower limit is **Gehenna**, and it's cast-power is dim in the depths of the lower planes; closer to the Negative Energy Plane. So an arrangement was made. The **Axiomites** made a bargain with the *Fifth Tribe of Solymn* to take up station in **Gehenna** and forever defend the realities from *the end of all things*.

### First World
Before **Az'Arot** touched the World of Naede, the First World was the Material Plane. It was a realm of pure nature, set up by the Deities. After **Az'Arot** touched it, the Material was divided from the Spiritual; the First and unending from the Last and finite. 

Now the First World is a primeval and emotional realm of nature spirits left over from the harsh division that ended their natural bliss. Chaotic, wild, and capricious. It is the home of Fey. 
### **Material Plane**
8 Known Planets of the Material Plane: 
- **Ylon**: Closest to the Star, a terrestial planet of boiled rock and heat blasted iron. 
- **Hygiea**: A planet of violent storms that is mostly oceans of mercury. Completely inhospitable. Second from the star.
- **Nede**: Main planet of the campaign setting, earth-like. 3rd from the star. 
- **Aegas**: A temperate terrestial planet, rotates at 90` of the plane. Regarded as a "garden world". 4th from the Star. 
- **Syne**: A terrestial frozen world with intense ash clouds from runaway volcanic activity. 5th from star.
- **Sorae**: An frigid ocean world of methane seas with terrestial archipelagos. 6th from the Star. 
- **Pallas**: A glittering gem of an massive stellar geode that has been cracked open like an egg. 7th from the Star. 
- **Serec**: A frozen gas giant of gargantuan proportions, islands of terrain float in the hydrogen/helium medium. 8th planet.

### <u>The Great Tyranny, Gehenna (Law Evil)</u>

Gehenna is a bleak plane that sits closest to "good" among all realms of evil. It is a place of tyranny and contrivance, it's realms are *desolate by design* - the scouring of the plane manufactured by it's masters; the Devils. The Devils are an expression chosen by fallen Celestial spirits. These same "fell" choosing a dark path to combat dark foes. They have made **Gehenna** a bulwark against the **Daemons** and **Demons** who lie 'beneath' them. Spread throughout the desolation of their own making are 64442 Spires of *Cold Iron*; each responsible for maintaining the defense from the planes that lay **even lower** than Gehenna. 

The Devil's have organized themselves into an extremely heirarchical military bureaucracy using fundamental constants of ***Order*** to empower themselves and **Gehenna** itself against the endless hordes of the lower planes. They draw upon the power of **Ordo, the Eternal Seal** to accomplish this - and it's shadow can be seen permeating Gehenna. 

The chief warlords of Gehenna are the Infernal Archduke's (see below), who worship their Magister Primarch **Asmodeus** who dwells within the Ruby Fortress at the center of Gehenna. 

8 Known Planets of Gehenna: 
- **Avernus**:      analog of **Ylon**, ruled by **Bel**
- **Dis**:          analog of **Hygiea**, ruled by **Dispater**
- **Minauros**:     analog of **Nede**, ruled by **Mammon**
- **Phlegethos**:   analog of **Aegas**, ruled by **Belial**
- **Stygia**:       analog of **Syne**, ruled by **Levistus**
- **Tartarus**:     analog of **Sorae**, ruled by **Glasya**
- **Maladomini**:   analog of **Pallas**, ruled by **Baalsebul**
- **Cania**:        analog of **Serec**, ruled by **Mephistopheles**
### Infinite Tower of Babel
Here, at the bottom of **Gehenna**, lies the base of the immeasurable **Infinite Tower of Babel**. A construction predating the oldest recorded ages, this massive tower rises from it's base in the scoured canyons  of **Gehenna** up and up; towering through planes and realities, past the Devils, Elementals, Inevitables and Celestials until it finds it's apex-mooring in **Ordo, the Eternal Seal**. 

The Tower is not a solid fixture, but is filled with endless rooms beyond reckoning, great halls and vast abandoned libraries. The Stygian waters pump to-and-fro up the length of the tower, sloshing their dissolutive fluids into the **Halls of the Dead** and back up to **Ordo**. 

Spirits of all manners and creeds have long ago breached this perilous endless dungeon and it is constantly (especially in the lowest reaches), the site of ceaseless battles between the Great Spirits' forces for control of the Tower. 

For the Tower sustains the **Eternal Seal**, which is responsible for the overspreading of life, and the supression of death in the cosmos. It is also the fastest way to travel throughout the planes without the use of magic or braving treacherous *portals*. 

### The Ravenous Dark, Apollyon (Chaos Evil)
Beneath **Gehenna**, passing beyond the waning influence of the **Eternal Seal** you reach the last place of Light from the Positive Energy Plane. A immense chasm yawning open to the depths that seems heave like the diaphragm of the cosmos itself! The Abyss, the Great Maw, or **Apollyon** the Destroyer is a realm home to the *Second Form of The End*; Demons - spirits not born of Positive Energy. 

Apollyon has a dank dampness to it, *abyssal moss* and vile fungi cloy to most surfaces across this plane of evil drinking up the last light of the Positive Energy Plane. No one knows how deep Apollyon goes, or from whence the Demons come - but they are endless. Eternal effulent of the **Primordial Chaos** beneath them mixes with the *shadowstuff* from the **Shadow Plane** and the *unlight* of the Negative Energy Plane, to endlessly produce the Spirits of material Destruction - bent on the annihilation of all order and matter. Only the strongest spirits survive here, and for the Demons that means Demonic Lords have risen as warlords; only their power preserves their station - and a single mistake will send the Lord's rulings into a power vaccuum. 

Their realm lies in shadows, cast by the *last light* mixing with the *Great Fangs of the Maw*, giving the Demons only a taste of *true life* - just enough to whet their appetites. 

No one has plumbed the unceasing ever twisting depths of Apollyon, but we know eventually it births out into **Pandemonium** below. As well, it's upside down is intimately woven into the **Shadow Plane** for such was the side-effect of the unblancing by the **Eternal Seal**. 

The Demons and their kin are eternally caught in a two-front war. Above them, blocking the way into the higher planes are the Devils - while below them are the soul devourers, the Daemons.
### The Primordial Chaos, Pandemonium (Chaos)

### <u>The Endless Desolation, Abaddon (Neutral Evil)</u>
Far beneath **Gehenna**, well beyond the **Light of Life** lies the darkest desmense. A realm of desolation unending, lifeless craggy peaks exaggerate the landscapes here - if one could even see them. For Abbadon is beyond all *light*, and there is only darkness eternal. This is the realm of the Daemons - these are the soul devourers, the unliving spirits of oblivion. They are the heralds of the **End of All Things**, *The First Form of Death* and are lead by the **Four Horsemen** greatest of all Death spirits.  

The Daemons, know not even the faintest taste of the **Light of Life** and so they crave the cessation of living souls; the taste of a living soul's annhilation is the sweetest sensation for a Daemon. And so while the **Horsemen** plot their great revelation, the lesser Daemons flit like shadows into **Gehenna** or delve through secret paths that lead into the **Halls of the Dead** where they may feast on departed souls unchecked. 

Since the **Age of the Powers** none from the living world have ever charted the breadth of **Abaddon**, but it is known the **Horsemen** dwell within mighty fortresses called *Chariots*, rumored to be hewn of *the unliving stone*. For **Abaddon** lies atop the **Endless Caverns, the Halls of the Dead**, and the jagged cragged surfaces of it's realms conceal the innumerable tunnels that proceed into those caverns. 


###  Aithzonthan, the Halls of the Dead 
In the most ancient days when a mortal passed it's spirit would depart from its body and enter **Aithzonthan** or the **Halls of the Dead**; a plane of endless caverns and twisting passageways. The Gods of the time before the Age of the Powers would send their emissaries into the caverns and guide the departed souls into their eternal resting places. 

When the Gods Before were undone, and The Powers took their place -- they kept to the same system. Mortals who died, would have their souls shephereded out of the caverns and into their final rest not according to their deeds in life, but The Powers inferior assessment of the souls' character upon discovery. 

Over the eons, this infrequent mismatching lead to the corruption of the Outer Houses, and dissolved the *telos* of the Outsider's purposes. Nevertheless, the Powers carried on. 

As the mortal world carried on The Elder Gods began to interfere in **Aithzonthan**. At first disrupting and distorting further the passage ways to confuse the Powers -- eventually morphing into a Pandemonium of lost Souls. **Zh'Ash** filled it with his foulness and it became a realm of horror & the mists of his power shrouded the infinite caverns. 

He became the thing which lurked in the dark and haunted the spirits of the deceased. His influence over mortal Death seeped into the living realms, and caused the dead to rise from their sleep.
