## History 

About 150 years ago, The King of Fjenst was embroiled in a war of conquest over the lands north of lake Hocklein. He saw the wildmen of the fields and their ferociousness in battle untamable by the formations of generals and peasants given spears. 

So he put out a call for any who could give him the edge in battle, in his war, he would annoint them Lords and give them a dominion in his empire. 

Many came; mages, maleficars, alchemists and masters of other bizarre arts from lands afar. None in the king's mind, could offer *the edge* he needed. 

Until the answer came. They had traveled far, hearing the offer of nobility and drawn by their thirst to restore what they had long ago lost. The Syrinx Gro'Ael arrived with his clan on the backs of massive raptors of legend. A great flock of Rocs and their avian masters. These birds could be ridden, tamed, and were a daunting menace consistently able to drive into and pick apart any host of men on land, sea or in the air. 

For their aid in the expansion of Fjenst - The King granted them a seat on the coastal mount of Sassen, and lordship over the lands of Morgenest.
