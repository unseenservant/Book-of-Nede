# Finzelzin

Finzelzin is a didactic monastery and center of learning located at the beginning of the great Eastern steppes, where the sea touches the flat of the lands before the steppes. 

The region is famed for sending out it's Wisemen to collect knowledge for its great library, for it's counselors and consulates, as well as its inspired ascetic devotion. 

Many legends surround Finzelzin - some say it was founded by a great Dragon long ago. Others say the monastery was built by Ientus as the first place where he could share his knowledge with man. Elves say the Tower that houses the monastery was stolen from them in a great war which even they've forgotten the details of. 

The wisemen (and women) are explorers, Pathfinders ðŸ˜‰ , and agents of knowledge throughout the lands of men.
