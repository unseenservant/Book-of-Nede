# World History of Nede 

## The Beginning

**Az'Arot, The Great Dreamer** is alone, in timeless slumber. From it's reverie came forth The Elder Gods, the great powers. They are made from it's dreams and bring forth it's nightmares. 

From the timeless void, The Elder Gods found Naede, a primordial world made out of nothing by the hands of some creator unknown to even themselves. They found it teeming with life not like their own, and it was raw and wild. 

Some of the Elder Gods thought to send emissarys to the small lives of the little world; while others thought to corrupt and destroy it. 

Their battle was a tumult and rippled across the boundaries of the little world like a hurricane; bending and shattering the structures upholding its grand order. The little world had Gods then, finite in scope, but great in power - and the Elder Gods tumult roused the little Gods to defend their island of existence. 

But the children of the **Great Dreamer** could not be undone by such little creatures. Their orders were upheaved by the Elder God's, their principalities and powers destroyed, their **portfolios** obliterated and ruined - that such things should never again be restored. 

With no Gods of their own many of the little lives wailed in madness or perished without guidance. Leaving behind sparse traces of their presence. The mighty ones fought for control of the world, and set great boundaries and orders of their own power. The weak could not and were enslaved by the strong. 

## The First Age 

The world of **Naede** had been overturned, it's God's destroyed by the eldritch forces of the Elder Gods who dwell in the void. Angels, Demons, and all manner of outsiders took up the mantels of their shattered houses and greatest among them assumed to inherit the power of their ruined deities. 

In their eternal war, they set great fortifications and boundaries - which mortals perceive as **the planes**, separated layers of reality laid atop **Naede** by the power of the Outsiders. 

They looked upon **Naede** and it's mortal races; and thought that without their Gods it would be better if they ruled them. So they enslaved the mortals, each according to their House, their beliefs, and their purposes. 

But the lives of mortals are fragile things, and outsiders careless in the face of such fragility. Many mortals perished in their bondage; many were transfigured into new races, and some lucky ones were lifted up and taught by the mightiest powers of the Age. 

One such race that was lifted up were those who would become **goblins** in the ages to come. They were shown great things, and given mighty songs of power. Taught the calculus of matter and the incantations of time. They served their Lords well. 

At the closing of the **First Age**, the Elder Gods sent emissaries of their own to guide the mortal races of the world either to weal or woe. These emissaries persuaded or lured some mighty outsiders, and many mortals to their eerie covenants. 

The goblins were one such (un)fortunate race to accept the offerings of the Elder Gods. Specifically **The Thing**, in service to **Ly'Khan** and followed it's teachings of ravenous strength - and were transformed from a one noble race into something akin to bats. Representing the swarm, the grotesque, and the spreading of their kind over the whole world. Their change came to their minds also - and the now goblins brought down the civilizations of the world; and such was their might and knowledge that they slew most of the Great Outsider Lords.
