# World History of Nede 

## The Beginning

At the earliest day, **Az'Arot, The Great Dreamer** was alone above all that was made. The Creator was nowhere to be found and the world beneath teemed with live very unlike its own. When **Az'Arot, The Great Dreamer** tried to reach into the world, its touch caused tumult and great devastation. The little lives could not perceive it and its prying caused much ruination. So it came to pass that in **Az'Arot, The Great Dreamer** a great lethargy overtook it and soonafter he entered its timeless slumber. 

From its reverie came forth The Elder Gods, the greatest powers. From it's dreams they are made and bring forth it's nightmares. In the timeless void, The Elder Gods also looked down upon Naede. They saw  it teeming with life not like their own, not like their progentior, and the world was raw and wild. 

Some of the Elder Gods thought to send emissarys to the small lives of the little world; while others thought to corrupt and destroy it. 

Their battle over Naede was like the shattering of glass and rippled across the boundaries of the little world like a hurricane; bending and ravaging the structures upholding its grand order. For the Elder Gods cared nothing for the order that was put in place. The little world had Gods then, finite in scope, but great in power - and the Elder Gods tumult roused the little Gods to defend their island of existence. 

But the children of the **Great Dreamer** could not be undone by such little creatures. Their orders were upheaved by the Elder God's, their principalities and powers destroyed, their **portfolios** obliterated and ruined - that such things should never again be restored. 

With no Gods of their own many of the little lives wailed in madness or perished without guidance. Leaving behind sparse traces of their presence. The mighty ones fought for control of the world, and set great boundaries and orders of their own power. The weak could not and were enslaved by the strong. 

## The Age of The Powers

The world of **Naede** had been overturned, it's God's destroyed by the eldritch forces of the Elder Gods who dwell in the void. Angels, Demons, and all manner of outsiders took up the mantels of their shattered houses and greatest among them assumed to inherit the power of their ruined deities. 

In their eternal war, they set great fortifications and boundaries - which mortals perceive as **the planes**, separated layers of reality laid atop **Naede** by the power of the Outsiders. 

They looked upon **Naede** and it's mortal races; and thought that without their Gods it would be better if they ruled them. So they enslaved the mortals, each according to their House, their beliefs, and their purposes. 

But the lives of mortals are fragile things, and outsiders careless in the face of such fragility. Many mortals perished in their bondage; many were transfigured into new races, and some lucky ones were lifted up and taught by the mightiest powers of the Age. 

One such race that was lifted up were those who would become **goblins** in the ages to come. They were shown great things, and given mighty songs of power. Taught the calculus of matter and the incantations of time. They served their Lords well. 

At the closing of the **First Age**, the Elder Gods sent emissaries of their own to guide the mortal races of the world either to weal or woe. These emissaries persuaded or lured some mighty outsiders, and many mortals to their eerie covenants. 

The goblins were one such (un)fortunate race to accept the offerings of the Elder Gods. Specifically **The Thing**, in service to **Ly'Khan** and followed it's teachings of ravenous strength - and were transformed from a one noble race into something akin to bats. Representing the swarm, the grotesque, and the spreading of their kind over the whole world. Their change came to their minds also - and the now goblins brought down the civilizations of the world; and such was their might and knowledge that they slew most of the Great Outsider Lords. 

Sealing their curse

## The Age of the Goblins 

Goblin genetic manipulation and magical world empire. Eventually brought low by more intereference from Elder Gods. 
## Age of the Titans (and Phaerimm, and Dragons) 
Replacing the Goblins and subduing their realms, Titans, Phaerimm & Dragons build up a new world of great wonders & mighty were the crafts of their hands. 

The greatest of these works were the Portals, and from them came the Slaad. 

## Age of the Slaad (and Troglodytes, and Lizardfolk)
From the depths of the Portals came the dregs of Az'Arot's nightmares -- the Slaad. Unleashed by the portals of the Titanic Age, they brought ruin to the wonderous works and set a new order - changing many mortals into Troglodytes and raising up the Lizardfolk to ursurp the power of the Dragons. 

The children of the Titanic Age eventually rose up with the arts of their Parents to subdue and reclaim the world from the Slaadi - the Elves and the Dwarves. The Elves use their **Soul Songs** to shape Ghostwood; and the Dwarves the craft of Titans to forge the **Great Golems** and **Warforged** legons. 

## Age of Elves & Dwarves
In this time, the great heroes of Elven myth and Dwarvish legend were born. The great weapons of war wrought by them which had devastated the Slaadi were now the instruments in creating a great age. The set the bounds of their empires across the face of Naede; The elves above and the Dwarves below. The orther mortals were slaves and fiefs to their domination and the power was not in any to resist them.

In the depths the Dwarves uncovered not one, but two great catacylsms: A Nameless Thing long sealed, the **goddess of spiders** & in the darkest depths the Orcs. 

## Age of the Orcs
The Orcs were innumerable, the long ago progeny of Elves whose very essence had been riven by the Goblin maesters of old. Left to breed in the deepest caverns of Goblindom for uncounted eons - the Dwarven delvers had reminded them of the surface world and a desire for conquest burned brightly guiding them back to the realms above. The Orcs burst forth it seemed like a flood of fury, steel, and war. So overwhelming was their might and indefagitable in their number that they washed over the world and under it - sweeping away the empires of all. 

In the days of the Orc, the Skys were darkened by their vile works, an plants would not yield up for the harvests; and the waters were guzzeled dry so that countless perished of thirst. 

As even the uncountable number of Orcs dwindled, what remained of the Elves, Dwarves and the mortal races yet to flourish banded together. They wrought great spells and took from the pages of many lost arts to create for themselves warriors and protectors to overturn the iron grip of the Orc. 

These were the **Founders**, the great **Houses of the Gods** made new. From all mortal races, were these immortal few raised up in the **power of legends**. These together brought ruin to the Orcs and restored green to the world, and clear blue to it's skies. 


## Age of the Founding (Gods) [The Current Age]
With the Orcs in decline and retreating, the Founders set for themselves new borders which did not acknowledge the days of the Elves and Dwarves. So amongst themselves the bonds of war were betrayed, and new wars were fought for territory, glory, and their own vanity. 

Again, the Elder Gods were roused, and **Zh'Ash, The Man in the Mist** would come upon them as a bolt of **red lightning**.
