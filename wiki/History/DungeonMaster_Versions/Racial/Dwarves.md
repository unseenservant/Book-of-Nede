# Dwarven History 

## Origins 

The Dwarves were the ultimate creation of the **Titans**. A perfect fusion of living flesh, unfeeling stone, and resolute metals. Formed and imbued with life, a secret that died with the **Titans**. But this new life they had forged held true and multiplied. 

**The Titans** taught their children much, training them in the ways of craftsmanship and instilling a care for the works of their hands. 

## Ancient History

### The Coming of the Slaadi 

When the **Titans** completed their greatest marvels; the portals. A terrible foe was awakened by their passage. The **Slaadi** race, that dwelt in the chaos in-between planes was stirred and burst forth into the avenues of the Portals. 

The Titans and their long time foes the **Phaerimm** were unprepared to face such a challenge. **The Titans** particularly cared for the fate of their creations, foremost of which their Dwarven children. 

The dwarves were buried by Colossi in deep vaults the Titans had preparred for in earlier wars with the Phaerimm. It was a heartwrenching evacuation, fathers separated from sons, mothers from husbands as each was carried away to a storehouse for safekeeping until the **Slaadi** menace was quelled. 

### In the Depths

Deep in the bowels of the planet, the Dwarves separated into shelters, separated from each other and their Titanic parents. They did what they had been taught to do. Not a single dwarf in those days thought they should just hide; or to heed the warning of their parents to forgo risk to themselves and not aid in the conflict. 

They excavated themselves from their vaults, and built up forges in their own fashion. They sent brave runners into the endless winding dark to find their fellows and re-establish contact. Many perished, but eventually they found each other. 

Scouts were sent to chart roads back to the surface, and they found it consumed by the **Slaadi**. What few brought word back alive, gave the Dwarves pause. Their concealment would be their safety - for the Slaad knew not they were there. 

They built up their industries and reforged as best they could mighty things in semblence of their forebears. Each vault needed each other, so the excavated great roads to interconnect their vaults - which grew into kingdoms, realms, and vast subterranean empires over the eons. Each day, their long memories kept the fires of vengeance burning in their hearts. Driven by purposes not forgotten; they built themselves up, carefully watched the surface and prepared to renew the war of their forefathers. 

### Meeting the Elves

When their preparations were nearly complete - the Dwarves had completed creation of a children of their own. Warforged. Like themselves, these were constructed of flesh, wood, stone and metal - but unlike the Titans; the Dwarves knew not how to imbue them with true life. 

It was at this time near completion, that their surface scouts were assailed not by Slaadi, but by a new species. These were tall, slender, with pointed ears and keener eyes. They called themselves Elves; and they had been surviving on the surface world striving against the Slaad in a constant desperation for survival. 

They had mingled ancient Goblin magicks with arts gleaned from the abandoned refuges of the Phaerimm, in their minds and developed a way to preserve a *living soul* from the consumption of **Slaad Death**. But they had no means of restoring it to life, or giving it form once more. 

So the Dwarven scouts revealed, knowing this could be the secret they needed for their children, the existence of the Warforged. 

Elven mages of their highest orders, and Dwarven Artificers met for months in deliberation; eventually yielding up long awaited success. 

The Elven magicks could produce a fair *semblance of life* if used without a soul and the Dwarven vessels gave the Elves what they needed to invent **Ghostwood** as an inhabitance for their departed. 

Together, their preparations complete - and the Slaadi numbers dwindled with time. The **Age of Leaf and Stone** began with the reconquest of their world, and vengeance for their parentage. 

## Middle History

### Age of Leaf and Stone

In this time, the **great deep roads** ran throughout all of Nede connecting the deep dwarven vaults with their budding surface realms. Pick and Hammer echoed through the dark depths of the world without end. The Titans were gone, but many Dwarves settled within the remnants of their forebears titanic ruins, rebuilding them best they could to restore their one-time grandeur. 

None could oppose them, save the Elves - who were so keen on having hard won peace, they ceded every mountain and each dell the Dwarves would claim - save only the Forests and green places for themselves. 

It was an amicable time. 

Lesser races began to flourish in the valleys and near the rivers, once the Elves had cleared them of the Slaadi pollution. 

### The Blackreach

Eventually the Dwarves in their industrial might and thirst for ever greater works, exhausted the land between their deep vaults and their surface realms. 

With nowhere left to turn, and a thirst for even greater crafts, they turned downward - further into the blackest depths of the world. Further than any had ever been. 

In their time as masters of the earth, they had encountered pockets of strange sunless creatures. Remnant Goblin horrors, nameless things. Even, though they had no name for them at the time, Orcs in small pockets easily wiped out. 

However, with their expeditions growing deeper and deepers - they came upon something unimaginable. **Something Sealed** away in the unlit places. 

When they came upon the thing, it tittered with unnatural clicks. Like a shadow on blackest darkness it scurried around them, pulling them one by one into its desmene. They struck Sunstones, which the dwarves immediately wished they had not. 

It revealed to them an ancient ediface beyond words or time, and a black form bigger than any monster ever could be; having shape and yet none. It peeled the minds back of the expedition driving them away into divers corners of the underdark mad. 

The **Nameless Monster** was never seen again. 

But the fleeing dwarves awoke the Orcs in full - and seeing both the madness of the Dwarves and discovering later the quality of the expedition realized that there was more and greater things above their heads than they had ever dreamed. 

### The Age of The Orc 

As the orcish hordes surged up from the deep, the Dwarves fought valiantly and silently from their Elven compatriots who dwelled ignorantly on the surface. 

The Orcs worship strength, and so no strength can deter them - so they were able to overcome the Dwarves and consume all in their path. 

They burst out onto the surface like a breaking damn. The Elves and surface Dwarves, all their empires, were drowned in the blood and might of the Orc.
