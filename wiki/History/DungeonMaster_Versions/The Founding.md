The Orcs were everywhere in those days. Their industry had blackened the sky, they had drank all the rivers dry and all the frozen wastes were melted. The great depths of the world were drawn up and poured forth in rivers of fire, the ash of which choked all green things and made them to die. 

The orcs were given strength by their Dark Gods, heroes of their kind. The might of them sundered mountains and split seas. Of their power, was the power of the eldest days and neither the Elves nor the Dwarves had any understanding of whence they had come to possess it. The greatest legions of leaf and steel, though terrible in their wrath, were outmatched in both fury and fire by the endless orcish hordes. 

Countless Dwarven realms in the deeps and the great mountains were razed, and what few were spared survived only by remaining hidden. So it was that they sealed their realms so that none could find them. Either with some dwarves remaining inside, while many others fled into the harshness of the surface to draw the Orcs away. 

The Elven courts were devastated and their woods riven to feed the horde. The greatest Elves fought in terrible battles that split the heavens and razed the very land in contest with the Orc Gods - but their might could not be beaten and the Elves were cast down from their highplaces and made to flee their eternal homes. 

For untold eons the numbers of Elves and Dwarves and their greatness dwindled like all living things under the heel of the Orc. Until in their endless consumption, the Orcish numbers began to dwindled for want. 

In this time, the Elves and Dwarves had so little strength of arms and were so scattered that they could never have mounted a reclamation even if they had the opportunity. 

It was a halfling, who brought hope back. For a lowly slave who was enthralled to Gruumsh himself found the secret of the Orcish heroes. The Power of the Elder days and how the Orcs had wielded it. 

She slipped away with the secret and passed from under the watch of his masters into the last lands of the freefolk. Everwhere Orcs roamed in these lands, hunting for the free races to devour them and there was no safety even here; except in secrecy for none knew that this halfling had stolen the knowledge of the Orcish Gods. 

She called forth a council of the last strength of the free peoples. The human House of Rosind, the Elven clan of Larethian, the Dwarven exiles Samman, the last Gnomish king and some few others. 

To them, and them alone, she revealed the secret of the Orcish Gods. Armed with the knowledge of power, the last strength of the free races vowed to make every effort to take back their world from the Orcs. 

In secret they arranged an expedition into the very heart of Nede, for within its bowels had the Orcs found what they needed to make Gods; and so too would the last strength of the free. 

The journey into the depths was perilous and many perished in their dire quest. But enough returned. 

Empowered as Gods themselves, they returned to the surface of Nede blazing in their wroth. Those who returned from the depths, the Founders of a new age were; 

For the Humans: 
- Sol Rosh of House Rosind
- his wife, Noxa 
- his brother, Rabelus 

For the Elves: 
- Corelleon Sunblade
- his brother, Rillifen
- his brother Solonor
- his wife (whom he met in the deep) Lolth

For the Gnomes: 
- Garl Glittergold, their last King
- his brother Segojan
- his son Baravar 
- his brother Callarduran

For the Halflings: 
- Yondalla, she who discovered the secret
- Arvoreen her adoptive sister
- Brandobaris, her adoptive brother and future husband. 

In the ensuring years of their reclamation they went on to have many children who inherited their godly powers. 

These and their progeny, in the end of obliterating the Orcs and driving their remnants back into the deep - the last strength of the free - called themselves The Founders and set for themselves new borders for their peoples and brought life and light back to the world.
