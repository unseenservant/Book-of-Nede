In the most ancient days when a mortal passed it's spirit would depart from its body and enter **Aithzonthan** or the **Halls of the Dead**; a plane of endless caverns and twisting passageways. The Gods of the time before the Age of the Powers would send their emissaries into the caverns and guide the departed souls into their eternal resting places. 

When the Gods Before were undone, and The Powers took their place -- they kept to the same system. Mortals who died, would have their souls shephereded out of the caverns and into their final rest not according to their deeds in life, but The Powers inferior assessment of the souls' character upon discovery. 

Over the eons, this infrequent mismatching lead to the corruption of the Outer Houses, and dissolved the *telos* of the Outsider's purposes. Nevertheless, the Powers carried on. 

As the mortal world carried on The Elder Gods began to interfere in **Aithzonthan**. At first disrupting and distorting further the passage ways to confuse the Powers -- eventually morphing into a Pandemonium of lost Souls. 

When **The Founders** established their power; two among them **Venecus & Ientus** sought to penetrate the mysteries of the afterlife. **Ientus** was insatiable in his quest for knowledge, and **Venecus** was in love with Death. Together they traveled to **Aithzonthan** and explored its depths returning with terrible knowledge. 

While this knowledge drove **Ientus** silent and made him a recluse, **Venecus** was stirred deeply. He sought to bargain with The Elder Gods - whom he had communed with in the unknowable depths of the **Aithzonthan**. 

**Venecus** wished to have power over Death itself and to make all mortals "live" forever in their bodies, undying. He began to experiment with necromancy, informed by his hidden knowledge of the **Aithzonthan** and his godly powers, he became an extraordinary Necromancer. He plumbed the depths of **Nede**, retrieving forgotten Goblinoid secrets of flesh mastery. He scoured the high places of the Powers, and ventured into their Outer realms to gain the information he sought. 

In the end, **Luxi** noticed his growing obsession and pursued him. She caught him there, in the midst of his great ritual to undo death; and chastised him before it was completed. Exactly as **Zh'ash** forsaw. For Lord of Decay wished dearly to blight all life in **Nede** and **Venecus**'s pursuit of power over death was to be his way in. 

In the incompleteness of the ritual, **Venecus** escaped into the depths of **Aithzonthan**, and **Luxi** who could've given chased, returned to the realm of the living and informed The other **Founders** of what **Venecus** had attempted. 

It was too late; in her journey back. Luxi had doomed all who would ever after trod **Aithzonthan**. For the ritual had allowed **Zh'Ash** to partially enter **Nede**, to enter **Aithzonthan**. He filled it with his foulness and it became a realm of horror & the mists of his power shrouded the infinite caverns. 

He became the thing which lurked in the dark and haunted the spirits of the deceased. His influence over mortal Death seeped into the living realms, and caused the dead to rise from their sleep. 

**Venecus** escaped his fate also, returning in secret to the living realms; and seeking to undo the damage he had wrought. But the **Founders** were out for his blood in recompense. 

So it is, that since the early days after the Founding, death is not a promise of peace - but a journey through Horror for the departed.
