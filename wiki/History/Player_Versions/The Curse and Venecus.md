# The Curse of Venecus 

## The Afterlife at the Beginning

In the most ancient days when a mortal passed it's spirit would depart from its body and enter the **Halls of the Dead**; a place of endless caverns and twisting passageways a blustering Pandemonium of departed Souls on their way to oblivion. 

## The Founders

When the Gods arose, they instituted a repreive for the souls of the departed. The deceased would be found by emissaries of the Gods they served in life, and if they were faithful stewards, they would be guided out of the Pandemonium and into a realm befitting of their service to the Gods. 

## Venecus and Death

When **The Founders** established their power **Venecus** fell in love with Death. He traveled to **Halls of the Dead** and explored its depths gaining terrible knowledge. **Venecus** was stirred deeply by what he learned. **Venecus** became an extraordinary Necromancer plumbing the depths of **Nede**, retrieving forgotten the secrets of flesh mastery and scouring in the high places for magics forbidden even to the gods. **Venecus** ventured into the Outer realms to threaten even the Outsiders if he was not made privy to the knowledge he sought. 

## Luxi's arrival

When radiant **Luxi** noticed his growing obsession she pursued him. Catching him in the midst of a great ritual to send all living into the afterlife. She rebuked him before his foul work could be completed. 

In failure of the ritual, **Venecus** escaped into the depths of The **Halls of the Dead**, and **Luxi** pursued him as deep as she could before she lost his trail in the endless labyrinth.

There **Venecus** dwelled in the hidden depths, filling it with his foulness and it became a realm of horror & the rank mists of his power shrouded the infinite caverns. 

He became the thing which lurked in the dark and haunted the spirits of the deceased. His influence over mortal afterlife seeped into the living realms causing the dead to rise from their sleep in places near to **his halls**. 

The **Founders** decreed a blood debt upon his head for his cursing the afterlife. 

So it is, that since the earliest days after the Founding, death is not a promised peace - but a risky journey through **The Mists of Venecus** for the departed. Their path lit only by their faith and a faint hope that they are found by the servants of their God; rather than the **Lord of the Dead**
