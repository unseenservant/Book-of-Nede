# World History of Naede 

## The Beginning


## The Age of The Powers

All manner of outsiders in their eternal war, they set great fortifications and boundaries - which mortals perceive as **the planes**, separated layers of reality laid atop **Naede** by the power of the Outsiders. 

They looked upon **Naede** and it's mortal races; and thought that without gods they could rule them. So the Outsiders enslaved the mortals, each according to their House, their beliefs, and their purposes. 

But the lives of mortals are fragile things, and outsiders careless in the face of such fragility. Many mortals perished in their bondage. 

One mortal race, the **goblins**, was lifted up by the Outsiders. They were shown great things, and given mighty songs of power and understood many secrets. They were taught the calculus of the world and the incantations of life. They served the Outsiders well, for a time. 

At the closing of this **Age of Powers**, the goblins betrayed their masters and followed a new path of **strange teachings** gaining a ravenous strength - and were transformed - from what legends say was a once noble race into monstrous bats. The representation of a swarming night, the grotesque, and the spreading of their kind over the whole world. Now the goblins brought down the very **Powers of the world** itself, such was their might and knowledge. They slew the Great Outsider Lords.Sealing themselves into their cursed forms.

## The Age of Bats

The goblins teemed and subdued all other life into their service. So great was their evil that extinction followed ever after them. What caused the goblins fall from might, no scholar can say what sent them scurrying into the wretchedness of their current existence. 

But what followed afterward was an age of great wonders. 

## Age of Great Works 
Legends say that after the goblins fell, there arose a civilization now lost that built many pillars, edifaces, and other great structures. This civilization we call 'The Titans' because of their architecture of great size. The Dwarves believe it was these who were their ancestors; while the Elves have records that it was the ancestors of the Giants. 

However, what is known is that it was during this time and to unify their great empire, that greatest of all works were forged the **Portals** and that from them came their downfall. 

## Age of Scales
From the depths of the Portals came vile nightmares unimagined. These monsters brought ruin to the wonders of the **Titans** and set up for themselves a new order - many mortals were taken into the deep place of the world and change was wrought in their flesh. Troglodytes and Lizardfolk were made from mortal flesh and their scaled masses bred for war were marshalled by the **nightmares** to ursurp the land of the **Titans**. 

The last children of the **Titans** eventually rose up with the arts of their wonders to beat back the **nightmares** and reclaim the world - the Elves and the Dwarves. The Elves use their **Soul Songs** to shape Ghostwood into mighty weapons; while the Dwarves used **Titancraft** to forge the **Great Golems** and **Warforged** legions. Ushering in a new age of wood & steel. 

## Age of Leaf & Steel

In this time, the great heroes of Elven myth and Dwarvish legend were born. The great weapons of war wrought by them which had devastated the **nightmares** were now the instruments in creating a new great age. They set the bounds of their empires across the face of Naede; The elves above and the Dwarves below. The other mortals were slaves or fiefs to their domination and the power was not in any other to resist them.

In the depths the Dwarves uncovered not one, but two great catacylsms: **A Nameless Thing** long sealed in the deep for which the Elves ever hold a grudge against the mountainfolk & in the darkest heart of the world they released the Orcs. 

## Age of the Orc

The Orcs were innumerable, the long ago progeny of Elves whose very essence had been riven by the Goblin maesters of old. Left to breed in the deepest caverns of Goblindom for uncounted eons - the Dwarven delvers had reminded them of the surface world and a desire for conquest burned brightly guiding them back to the realms above. The Orcs burst forth it seemed like a flood of fury, steel, and war. So overwhelming was their might and indefagitable in their number that they washed over the world and under it - sweeping away the empires of all. 

In the days of the Orc, the skies were darkened by their vile works, plants would not yield up for the harvest, and the waters were guzzeled dry so that countless perished of thirst. 

As even the uncountable number of Orcs dwindled, what remained of the Elves, Dwarves and the mortal races yet to flourish banded together. They wrought great spells with the last of their might and took from the pages of many lost arts to create for themselves warriors and protectors to overturn the iron grip of the Orc. 

These were the **Founders**, the great **Houses of the Gods**. From all mortal races, were these few raised up to become immortal, burning with the **New Power** they had made. These together in the **Founding Alliance** brought ruin to the Orcs and restored green to the world, and clear blue to it's skies. 


## Age of the Founding (Gods) [The Current Age]
With the Orcs in decline and retreating, the **Founders** set for themselves new borders which did not acknowledge the days of the Elves and Dwarves. So it was that they betrayed the brotherhood of war, and new conflicts were fought for territory, glory, and the preservation of their peoples. 

Many lands that were restored, were ruined anew, burned sterile by the **divine power** of the Gods and their armies. But at last, finally, each mortal race has its realms and while some battles and old grudges yet linger - the world knows a final lasting peace.
