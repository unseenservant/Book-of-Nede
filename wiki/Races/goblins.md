# Goblins 

![Nede Goblin](/src/goblin.jpg "Nede Goblin")

## Overview

Having bat-like features, Goblins are pale or pink skinned Sun hating monsters with a complex social system of tribal and shamanistic tradition. 

Cruel and hostile towards other races, Goblin society is brutal, warlike, shortsighted and short. 

## History & Geography

Once fabled to have ruled great territories in an mythical civilization, the Goblins of recorded history are a fractured and divide mass of innumerable tribes each competing with each other; as well as the other races, for land. 

For as long as elves can remember, Goblins have been cave dwelling and inferior - if numerous - brigands who reave and raid civilized lands for resources. 

Predominantly found in boreal or mountainous regions, Goblins are adept finding large cave networks to shelter their tribes. The known pattern of Goblin tribal rule is cycle of strife: settlment, growth, war, internal division, dissolution, migration. 

In the North, several variants of Goblins have been noted: Goblins, Bugbears, Hobgoblins, Chiropts, Screechers, Blue furs. It is common (at least in the North) for these sorts of Goblins to intermingle and co-habitate as part of cohesive tribal bands. 

Save for the Hobgoblins who are usually homogenous and eschew the presence of the other variants. 

Several major tribal unions have been observed throughout the centuries at uncharacteristic periods of great cohesion among the Goblins. These periods have lead to several sizable wars that have threatened not only nations, but on occassion, entire continents. 

It is believed that a significant portion of the Goblin race dwells beneath Nede -- and that the tribes encountered on the surface are only splinters of a larger super colony. 

## Religion & Society

Goblin society (at least among the North) is tribal and divided into two. Day to day tribal "order" is imposed by the chieftan, a single warlord who rules the entire tribe absolutely. Goblins strongly believe in what could be called *might makes right*; and are quick to rally around the strongest amongst them. 

In their frequent conflicts with other races and themselves this can lead to rapid-fire leadership changes if a series of chiefs are considered too weak. 

Interestingly, unlike Orcs, Goblins are not opposed to female Chieftans and while females tend to be physically weaker - they are also much more devious than males. Corollary, Goblins do not view strength as a simple Orcish element of muscle, but as the ability to enforce one's will on others. Whether by strength of arms, cunning, or otherwise. 

Little is known about the Goblin religion, except that it is perpetuated by the highly revered Chiropts variant. A large goblin with bat-like wings these are inborn with powers of natural [Discord](/wiki/Magic/MagicKinds.yaml "Discord"). Highly intelligent, these Chiropt creatures serve as shamans and wisewomen for tribes lucky enough to have one. Notably, tribes with a Chiropt tend to be more insular and somewhat less warlike than tribes without a Chriopt. 

Where Chiropts are not present, shaman duties tend to fall upon female goblin shamans (or occassionally druids, and rarely oracles) which serve to interpert the guidances of far off Chiropts or their Dark God. 

The Goblin deity is believed by competent scholars to be a myth -- much like some mystery cults among the civilized races. However, they do not speak its name and instead refer to it only as their 'Beloved Tyrant'.
