# Halflings

## Culture

Halflings are lovers of personal freedom, which is emblematic of their migratory life as nomads. There are three (3) primary subraces of Halflings are Lightfoots, Wild Hair, and Ghostwise. Lightfoots are the most common sort, and are typically found in the Northlands and all throughout **Teir** and the lands throughout and bordering the **Sterile Lands**. Wild Hair halflings aren't any less numerous but are far less common as their caravans range far further from human lands than lightfoots. Wild Hairs are "more barbarous" in appearance and even less likely not to commit common social taboos (such as theivery). However, let there be no mistake, Wild Hair halflings are not barbarous by any means - having a deep society full of tradition and a disdain for warfare; prefering amicable mercantile relations. Their archers though are renowed to be as precise as their legerdemain. Finally, Ghostwise halflings are the strange Halflings from southern **Eir**, and bare a strong resemblence to the humans of Shang or Sihnon. This similarity is only skin deep - as Ghostwise possess a deep non-verbal form of communication impossible for others to learn. They are the most territorial of any halfling group, though still nomadic within their very loose borders. Their territory spans the **Pillars of Eir**, great thin mountains and dense jungles. This has made them a reliable method of overland traders, as only they are able to safely navigate their impenetrable jungle homes. 

## History 

Unlike many other mortal races, Halfings have never had a mighty empire or ancient civilization of high glory. That is not to say that the halflings are not a noble and civilized society - quite the contrary - but they have never pursued *grandeur* in the same way that other races have. 

Since the time of **the Founding**, **Yondalla, Queen of Shortfolk** has guided her people across the face of Naede. She has a small family, compared to other **Founders** and the Halfling pantheon each leads their troupes in a never ending migration. In the rare occassions when the sagest of Halflings transcribes their histories, their nomadic lifestyle seems to predate even **the Founding**. 

The Halflings have not been absent the conflicts or wars of the world; and indeed have been some of the greatest heroes and warriors in all History. Halfling caravans often stick close to human settlements or travel between them, intimately tying them to the struggles of the civilizations of tall folk. 

In the **Wars of Upheaval** following **the Founding**, The **House of Yondalla** lead their people in a rare time of collective unity, in battle against the **Striven cause** and a monument was built in **Gjessera** to their honor and sacrifice at the edge of **the Sterile Lands**.

Even less is known about the Halflings prior to **the Founding** though all agree their nomadic migratory ways were well developed even in this pre-history. What is curious though are the references in antiquity to halflings as slaves in numerous other annals of differing civilizations past. This has lead many scholars to conclude that due to the transitory proclivities of Halfings, they were historically ill-equipped to defend themselves against being taken captive by more powerful societies; if they wandered too near. 

This potential history of slavery might well explain the Halfling's cultural love of personal freedom and abhorrence for complex soceities.
