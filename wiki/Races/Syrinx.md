So for the Syrinx 

At one point it was believed that Syrinx had an ancient civilization which covered most of the continent of Deir. When their civilization fell, the Syrinx spread out - living in old forests, high hills, and making settlements where they could be secluded. 

As Elves and later men - and their Gods encroached upon Syrinx territories; as always happens when civilizations meet, war was inevitable. Where the Syrinx gods dwelt with their avian people, the Syrinx held out strongest. Where they did not, the gods of the other humanoids were victorious. 

This eventually lead to 3 major populations of Syrinx. Eastern, Southern, and Western - developing a little bit differently (to reflect the speciation of real life owls) and their societies differentiated

Today, with that past long behind them
Syrinx are fairly well integrated into the human form of society. The typical Syrinx still preferring to dwell in small cloisters of their own kind just at the edges of the wilderness, but still close at hand to human settlments. Humans for the most part benefit from Syrnix's natural wisdom, while the Syrinx benefit from humankind's coordinated hunting ability. 

When Syrinx dwelling in human societies reach adulthood, the urge to strike out from their cloister & family grips them as a natural instinct, causing the eventual development of new cloisters adjacent to different human settlements. 

Thus there is always the rare presence of Syrinx in most humanoid lands. Making up a very small minority. 

Occasionally, many Syrinx will gather to form an Aerie or monastery, and these can overtime grow into quite the centers of learning
