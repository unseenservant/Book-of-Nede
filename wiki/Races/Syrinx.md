So for the Syrinx 

At one point it was believed that Syrinx had an ancient civilization which covered most of the continent of Deir. When their civilization fell, the Syrinx spread out - living in old forests, high hills, and making settlements where they could be secluded. 

As Elves and later men - and their Gods encroached upon Syrinx territories; as always happens when civilizations meet, war was inevitable. Where the Syrinx gods dwelt with their avian people, the Syrinx held out strongest. Where they did not, the gods of the other humanoids were victorious. 

This eventually lead to 3 major populations of Syrinx. Eastern, Southern, and Western - developing a little bit differently (to reflect the speciation of real life owls) and their societies differentiated
