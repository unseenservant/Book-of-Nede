## Artifact (as Ring of Callaran)

The Ring of Callaran makes the wielder slightly shadowy and incorporeal, granting him a +4 sacred bonus to AC and on Reflex saves. However, in bright light (such as that of the sun, but not a torch) or in absolute darkness, the wielder takes a â€“2 penalty on all attack rolls, saves, and checks. The Ring of Callaran also has the following powers.

- *Shadow Bolt*: Three times per day, the staff can project a ray attack that deals 10d6 points of cold damage to a single target. The shadow bolt has a range of 100 feet.
- *Shadow Form*: Three times per day, the wielder can become a living shadow, with all the movement powers granted by the *Dust Form* spell.
- *Summon Nightshade*: Once per month, the staff can summon a nightcrawler nightshade that serves the wielder as if called by a summon monster IX spell cast at 20th level.
- *Summon Shadows*: Three times per day, the staff may summon 2d4 shadows. Immune to turning, they serve the wielder as if called by a summon monster V spell cast at 20th level.
